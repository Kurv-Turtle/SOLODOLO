D. in composition from the University of Chicago. Bacos graduated from MIT in 1993 with a SB in Aerospace Engineering and a SB in Music. When he began studies at MIT in the fall of 1989 he had no idea that he would end up with a career in music rather than in aerospace engineering. Music was just a hobby for him but when he finished his degree in Engineering he was one class short of completing a major in music. Bacos stayed an extra year at MIT to complete the music major requirement. &quot;That fifth year proved pivotal, &quot; he says. With John Harbison as a focal inspirational point, he took the leap and made the decision to pursue graduate studies in composition rather than engineering. As Bacos points out, he received his musical training from a school whose reputation is built on science and engineering, yet he says, &quot; there are few places I can think of that could have given me the knowledge and opportunity to prepare me for both paths [music &amp; engineering]; even fewer places that could have prepared me to make [a] choice. MIT has made all the difference.&quot; Baco's third String Quartet was performed by the Pacifica Quartet on two concert programs this past summer. &nbsp; David J. Bondelevitch '85 David J.

D. in composition from the University of Chicago. Bacos graduated from MIT in 1993 with a SB in Aerospace Engineering and a SB in Music. When he began studies at MIT in the fall of 1989 he had no idea that he would end up with a career in music rather than in aerospace engineering. Music was just a hobby for him but when he finished his degree in Engineering he was one class short of completing a major in music. Bacos stayed an extra year at MIT to complete the music major requirement. &quot;That fifth year proved pivotal, &quot; he says. With John Harbison as a focal inspirational point, he took the leap and made the decision to pursue graduate studies in composition rather than engineering. As Bacos points out, he received his musical training from a school whose reputation is built on science and engineering, yet he says, &quot; there are few places I can think of that could have given me the knowledge and opportunity to prepare me for both paths [music &amp; engineering]; even fewer places that could have prepared me to make [a] choice. MIT has made all the difference.&quot; Baco's third String Quartet was performed by the Pacifica Quartet on two concert programs this past summer. &nbsp; David J. Bondelevitch '85 David J.

Like most MIT students, he didn't come to MIT to be a music major, but says he was impressed and wooed by the quality of the music faculty. He remarks on the&quot; small class sizes and the extremely bright and talented fellow students who provided a stimulating environment for learning with the support of a fine music library.&quot; He claims that a major contribution to his development as a musician was the availability of performance opportunities on the MIT campus and in the Boston area. &quot;The undergraduate education I obtained was an excellent preparation for postgraduate studies in music, with a well-balanced (but flexible) distribution of emphases on theory, history and performance, says Hutchinson, whose postgraduate studies culminated in an A.M. degree in music performance and a nearly-finished Ph.D. in historical musicology from Stanford University. A frequent workshop and summer school coach, clinician and tutor, he is on the editorial board for the Journal of the Viola da Gamba Society of America. He is also a barytonist (baritone viol player) and recently played Haydn's baryton music in the Eszterhazy palaces in Hungary and Austria.

Mehta began trumpet studies at the age of 10 in NJ, USA and graduated as an engineer from MIT in 1986 and was mentored by MIT Music Lecturer, Trumpeter and Bandleader Mark Harvey and then a year of composition studies from 1989-1990 at the Mills College Contemporary Music Center, Oakland with avant-garde jazz saxophonist/composer Anthony Braxton. Mehta was invited to Switzerland for his first professional music tour in 1991 and the rest is history – spanning a well-documented international professional playing, recording, composing, lecturing and producing music career based first in Amsterdam with parallel extensive tours with modern dance companies in France and musical projects in unusual acoustical spaces in Czech republic and then a 7 year residence in Berlin (1998-2005) with awards leading him to Cork, Ireland, and Chennai, India and presently in Mumbai where he is the founder/artistic director of his longstanding vision for a pioneering music institution in India/Asia: ORKA-M: International Institute of Innovative Music – an international platform for innovative musical production, research and educational activities with a specific focus on intercultural and interdisciplinary collaborations which he is presently establishing in Asia. He performs on his trumpet innovation, the &quot;hybrid trumpet&quot; – an extended multiple trumpet instrument that has dramatically opened up new percussive and sonic possibilities as well as on a microtonal slide-trumpet which has an additional trombone-like slide for bending notes made by manufacturer Holton. He performs and composes for his ensembles such as Trio ORKA-M featuring his closest musical partners the great Sri Lankan Contemporary music Cellist Rohan de Saram and South Indian musicians such as percussionist Jay Rao. With a view towards inter-disciplinary and inter-cultural collaboration he has worked on a series of &quot;imaginational maps&quot; and &quot;songlines' jewels&quot; which make use of innovative musical notation as an art form and one of his works will be published in Spring 2009 in an anthology of new musical notation entitled Notations 21 inspired by John Cage. These drawings and narrative paintings are notes and reflections of his musical ideas on paper and have also lead to his interdisciplinary music-architecture project series sounding buildings which transforms unusual buildings into resonating musical instruments. www.rajesh-mehta.com &nbsp; John William Miller, Jr.'64 BS XXI was an active member of the professional music community of Boston while he studied at MIT.

                   <p><strong>Pelarin Bacos '93</strong></p>
                   <p>An aerospace engineer with an MA in music composition from the University of Chicago claims that he learned how to fly at MIT, but not the way he had planned, he ended up flying off the engineering wagon onto the music train: a Ph. D. in composition from the University of Chicago.</p>
                   <p>Bacos graduated from MIT in 1993 with a SB in Aerospace Engineering and a SB in Music. When he began studies at MIT in the fall of 1989 he had no idea that he would end up with a career in music rather than in aerospace engineering. Music was just a hobby for him but when he finished his degree in Engineering he was one class short of completing a major in music. Bacos stayed an extra year at MIT to complete the music major requirement. "That fifth year proved pivotal, " he says. With John Harbison as a focal inspirational point, he took the leap and made the decision to pursue graduate studies in composition rather than engineering.</p>
                   <p>As Bacos points out, he received his musical training from a school whose reputation is built on science and engineering, yet he says, " there are few places I can think of that could have given me the knowledge and opportunity to prepare me for both paths [music &amp; engineering]; even fewer places that could have prepared me to make [a] choice. MIT has made all the difference." Baco's third String Quartet was performed by the Pacifica Quartet on two concert programs this past summer.</p>

                   <p><strong>David Breitman '76 </strong></p>
                   <p>David Breitman is a pianist who graduated from MIT with an SB in Humanities (Music). He performed as cellist with the MIT Symphony and played recorder and harpsichord in the Wellesley Collegium Musicum. In Boston he studied piano with Patricia Zander, chamber music with Ben Zander and fortepiano with Malcom Bilson and obtained an MM in piano performance from the New England Conservatory and a DAM in Performance Practice in 18th century instrumental music from Cornell University. David Breitman is equally at home with the fortepiano and the modern piano, and his growing discography reflects that versatility. He recorded a major new song cycle by the Cuban-American composer Jorge Martin with baritone Sanford Sylvan, after giving the 65-minute work its New York premiere at Carnegie Recital Hall. This was the fourth recital record with Sylvan, following "Beloved that Pilgrimage" (three 20th century song cycles) Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin (using a replica of a Graf fortepiano), and an all-Fauré disc. "Pilgrimage" and the Fauré were nominated for Grammy awards. This past year also saw the release of the complete Mozart violin-fortepiano sonatas with Jean-François Rivest, available as a 4-CD set on Amberola. Breitman has been involved in another large project: a complete Beethoven piano sonata cycle on original instruments, shared among seven fortepianists. This series, originally presented as a series of eight concerts at New York's Merkin Hall in 1994, was then recorded for the CLAVES label, and performed live, again at the "Accademia Bartolomeo Cristofori" in Florence. A Montreal native, Mr. Breitman now teaches at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, where he directs the Historical Performance program.</p>

                   <p><strong>Roland Hutchinson '76</strong></p>
                   <p>MIT alumnus Roland Hutchinson is a freelance performer and private teacher of viola da gamba. He graduated from MIT in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Humanities and Science. A founding member of the MIT Early Music Society, he participated in "anything and everything that had strings in it," on an off the MIT campus.</p>
                   <p>Like most MIT students, he didn't come to MIT to be a music major, but says he was impressed and wooed by the quality of the music faculty. He remarks on the" small class sizes and the extremely bright and talented fellow students who provided a stimulating environment for learning with the support of a fine music library." He claims that a major contribution to his development as a musician was the availability of performance opportunities on the MIT campus and in the Boston area.</p>
                   <p>"The undergraduate education I obtained was an excellent preparation for postgraduate studies in music, with a well-balanced (but flexible) distribution of emphases on theory, history and performance, says Hutchinson, whose postgraduate studies culminated in an A.M. degree in music performance and a nearly-finished Ph.D. in historical musicology from Stanford University.</p>
                   <p>A frequent workshop and summer school coach, clinician and tutor, he is on the editorial board for the Journal of the Viola da Gamba Society of America. He is also a barytonist (baritone viol player) and recently played Haydn's baryton music in the Eszterhazy palaces in Hungary and Austria. Roland will be performing two concerts at Kings Chapel, Boston, in September and will make other appearances in the area in January.</p>
                   <p>He has been praised in the press for the "eloquence and virtuosity" of his playing, his "spry and elegant technique," and "a lovely, pure and ringing tone" as well as the "extraordinary vigor" and "passionate feeling" of his performances. Roland has recordings on the Centaur and Erato labels. In addition to performing alone and with well-known ensembles in the United States and in Europe, he has taught and presented lecture-demonstrations at many major universities in the United States.</p>

                   <p><strong>Rajesh Kantilal Mehta '86</strong></p>
                   <p>Rajesh Mehta , MIT '86 (born 1964 in Calcutta now Kolkata, India), artistic director and founder ORKA-M: International <u>Institute of Innovative Music</u> is an internationally renowned hybrid trumpet player, ensemble leader, composer, and engineer who makes music-artworks. Mehta began trumpet studies at the age of 10 in NJ, USA and graduated as an engineer from MIT in 1986 and was mentored by MIT Music Lecturer, Trumpeter and Bandleader Mark Harvey and then a year of composition studies from 1989-1990 at the Mills College Contemporary Music Center, Oakland with avant-garde jazz saxophonist/composer Anthony Braxton.</p>
                   <p>Mehta was invited to Switzerland for his first professional music tour in 1991 and the rest is history – spanning a well-documented international professional playing, recording, composing, lecturing and producing music career based first in Amsterdam with parallel extensive tours with modern dance companies in France and musical projects in unusual acoustical spaces in Czech republic and then a 7 year residence in Berlin (1998-2005) with awards leading him to Cork, Ireland, and Chennai, India and presently in Mumbai where he is the founder/artistic director of his longstanding vision for a pioneering music institution in India/Asia: <em>ORKA-M: International Institute of Innovative Music</em> – an international platform for innovative musical production, research and educational activities with a specific focus on intercultural and interdisciplinary collaborations which he is presently establishing in Asia.</p>
                   <p>He performs on his trumpet innovation, the "hybrid trumpet" – an extended multiple trumpet instrument that has dramatically opened up new percussive and sonic possibilities as well as on a microtonal slide-trumpet which has an additional trombone-like slide for bending notes made by manufacturer Holton. He performs and composes for his ensembles such as Trio ORKA-M featuring his closest musical partners the great Sri Lankan Contemporary music Cellist Rohan de Saram and South Indian musicians such as percussionist Jay Rao. With a view towards inter-disciplinary and inter-cultural collaboration he has worked on a series of "imaginational maps" and "songlines' jewels" which make use of innovative musical notation as an art form and one of his works will be published in Spring 2009 in an anthology of new musical notation entitled <em>Notations 21</em> inspired by John Cage. These drawings and narrative paintings are notes and reflections of his musical ideas on paper and have also lead to his interdisciplinary music-architecture project series <em>sounding buildings</em> which transforms unusual buildings into resonating musical instruments. <a href="http://www.rajesh-mehta.com/">www.rajesh-mehta.com</a></p>
