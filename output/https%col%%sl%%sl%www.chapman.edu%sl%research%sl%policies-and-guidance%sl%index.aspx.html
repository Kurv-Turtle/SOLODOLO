           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Defines the term animal and describes the structure of the animal care and use program (ACUP) at Chapman University.</p>
            <h3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>Chapman University is committed to the highest ethical standards of animal care and use. Each Chapman investigator, student or instructor wishing to use animals on or off campus must conduct all animal work in accordance with the standards, laws, regulations, and policies governing the care and use of animals. The university maintains an animal care and use program based upon the principles of USDA’s Animal Welfare Regulations, the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the <em>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</em>, and other taxon-specific guidelines.</p>
            <h3>REASON FOR THE POLICY</h3>
            <p>This policy defines the term animal and describes the structure of the animal care and use program (ACUP) at Chapman University. Further, this policy establishes the authority and responsibilities of Principal Investigators (PI), the Institutional Official (IO), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the Attending Veterinarian (AV), and other stakeholders including Environmental Health and Safety, Office of Sponsored Projects Services, the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
            <h3>POLICY</h3>
            <p>Chapman University is committed to the ideals of integrity and respect for the environment in all areas of research, teaching, and service (Chapman University Code of Ethics). The ACUP at Chapman applies to all Chapman research and teaching activities involving live vertebrate animals. The program conforms to: 1) the <em>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</em> (National Research Council, 2011); 2) regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture issued by the USDA implementing the Animal Welfare Act (AWA); 3) the Public Health Service’s<em> Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</em>, and 4) California’s Department of Public Health (CDPH).</p>
            <p>Chapman University has filed an Animal Welfare Assurance further defining its commitment to the ethical use of live vertebrate animals in activities supported by the Public Health Service and/or the National Science Foundation. Oversight of the Chapman ACUP rests primarily with the IO, the IACUC and the AV. Secondarily, the ACUP also requires the participation and commitment of individual researchers, animal care personnel, the Office of Research staff, and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) personnel. This policy describes the authority and responsibilities of these individuals in the ethical care and use of animals.</p>
            <p>The term “animal,” for the purposes of the animal care program at Chapman University, includes all independent live vertebrate members of the Phylum <em>Chordata</em>, Class <em>Vertebrata</em> (all vertebrates) used in research, education, or testing. The determination of when an embryonic animal is considered an independent entity varies by the class of the animal. <strong>Any use of an animal in research, education or testing at Chapman University requires IACUC review and approval</strong>. The use of animal by-products, such as tissues or antibodies, is not included in IACUC oversight. Obtaining them may be subject to import controls and inter-institutional assurances, however.</p>
            <p>The Office of Research and the IACUC recognize the collaborations which researchers and principal investigators enter. The responsibilities of PIs include:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Preparing and submitting IACUC protocols to describe the proposed usage of animals, verifying approval prior to conducting any research or teaching activity, and for adhering to the content within approved protocols</li>
             <li>Requesting approval from the IACUC for changes to approved studies through a protocol amendment, and implementing those changes only after receipt of written (electronic) approval from the IACUC</li>
             <li>Resubmitting each protocol for <em>de novo</em> IACUC review at least once every three years if animal work is continuing and ensuring that IACUC approval for the renewal is granted before the initial approval has expired, or suspending animal work until written (electronic) approval of the renewal has been obtained</li>
             <li>Reporting, at least annually, the status of each protocol to assure that ongoing activities are conducted in accordance with an approved protocol</li>
             <li>Following all applicable facility standards, guidelines, and procedures in the conduct of the animal work</li>
             <li>Promptly notifying the IACUC of any unexpected results that affect the welfare of the animals under their animal protocol by reporting any unanticipated pain or distress, morbidity, or mortality</li>
             <li>Ensuring that personnel working on their protocols are appropriately trained and qualified for the procedures they are performing (personnel include PIs, research staff, students, and volunteers)</li>
             <li>Informing personnel of the risks and hazards associated with working with animals in research and teaching environments, which includes consulting with EH&amp;S</li>
             <li>Maintaining clinical (veterinary) health and protocol procedural records.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The President of Chapman University has delegated the responsibilities and authority of ACUP to the Vice President for Research (VPR) in the capacity of IO. The IO has the authority and responsibility to:</p>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Chapman University's policy and notice regarding the U.S. government's policy prohibiting human trafficking, sex trafficking, forced labor, and trafficking-related activities.</p>
            <h3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>The U.S. government has adopted a policy prohibiting human trafficking, sex trafficking, forced labor, and trafficking-related activities. As a recipient of federal funds from grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts (collectively “awards”), Chapman University is obligated to inform its employees, agents, independent contractors and subrecipients performing awards, regarding the U.S. government’s policy. Chapman University opposes human trafficking, sex trafficking, and forced labor, which are inherently harmful and contrary to Chapman University’s core values and which may violate applicable foreign, U.S., state, and/or local laws.</p>
            <h3>REASON FOR THE POLICY</h3>
            <p>As a recipient of federal awards, Chapman University is obligated to inform its employees, agents, independent contractors and subrecipients performing awards, regarding the U.S. government’s policy.</p>
            <h3>POLICY</h3>
            <p>Human Trafficking (or “trafficking in persons” as used in the U.S. government policy) includes the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of persons through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. It also includes sex trafficking, and inducing a commercial sex act by force, fraud or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform a commercial sex act is under 18 years old. (Definitions of other relevant terms used in the policy are set forth in the U.S. government’s regulations implementing its policy, available at 2 CFR §175.15 for grants and cooperative agreements and 48 CFR §52.222-50 for federally funded contracts).</p>
            <p>Chapman University, its employees, agents, independent contractors, and subrecipients of federal funds (and their respective employees), are prohibited from the following:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Engaging in human trafficking or sex trafficking, or procuring commercial sex acts, during the award period;</li>
             <li>Using forced labor to perform the award;</li>
             <li>Destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access to an individual’s identity or immigration documents;</li>
             <li>Using misleading or fraudulent practices about the recruitment process for work on a project outside the U.S., such as failing to disclose, in a format and language accessible to the potential worker, key terms and conditions of the engagement, such as wages and fringe benefits, work location, living conditions, housing costs, and any hazardous nature of the work;</li>
             <li>Using recruiters that do not comply with local labor laws in the countries in which recruiting takes place;</li>
             <li>Charging recruitment fees to the individuals recruited to work on the award;</li>
             <li>Providing or arranging housing that fails to meet host country housing and safety standards;</li>
             <li>If required by law or contract, failing to provide an employment contract, recruitment agreement, or similar work paper in writing in the employee’s native language prior to the employee departing from his or her country of origin to work on the contract in another country; and</li>
             <li>Under certain circumstances, failing to supply return transportation, or payment for return transportation, at the conclusion of the work, if the worker is not a national of the country in which the work occurs and was brought into the country to work on the federal award.</li>
            </ul>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Provides policy guidance on the ownership, assignment and control of intellectual property rights in copyrightable works by members of the Chapman community.</p>
            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>This Copyright Policy governs the ownership and control of intellectual property rights in copyrightable works at Chapman University (the “University”). All faculty, academic staff, as well as non-employees who participate in teaching and/or research or scholarship projects at the University are bound by this policy (such persons are referred to as the “Author(s)”). They are also required to sign the Chapman University Patent and Copyright Agreement found on the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage. This policy applies, and those subject to this policy are deemed to assign their rights, to copyrightable works as required under this policy whether or not a Chapman University Patent and Copyright Agreement is signed and is on file.</p>
            <p>For purposes of this policy only, the term “academic staff” refers to post-doctoral candidates, senior scientists, visiting researchers, administrators holding a concurrent tenured faculty rank and other staff that may be so designated from time to time. Other University staff are subject to a separate policy. This policy cannot address every situation that may arise in the development, enforcement and management of intellectual property rights. Rather, this policy is intended to serve as a set of guidelines for University Authors. This policy is established with the understanding that it may be supplemented by statements of policy, or other interpretive guidance, focused on particular circumstances, especially those arising out of new media or technology. Further, this policy itself may be amended over time to effect changes deemed to be in the best interest of the University community.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The University’s policy governing patentable inventions, including patentable software, is contained on the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage.</p>
            <h3>GENERAL POLICY</h3>
            <p>Subject to the exceptions noted below and in keeping with longstanding academic tradition, ownership of copyright in textbooks, scholarly publications, art works, motion pictures, musical compositions literary works, or other pedagogical works regardless of the medium of expression, resides with the Author. Ownership of any trademarks associated with such works also resides with the Author except to the extent any such trademark incorporates or would otherwise infringe on a trademark owned or in use by the University.” The only exceptions to Author ownership of copyrightable works are as follows:</p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Commissioned Works</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Where the Author is requested or commissioned by the University to create copyrightable material, the resulting work shall be owned by the University. All online courses are considered commissioned works.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Institutional Works</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             The University shall retain ownership of Institutional Works. Institutional Works include:
            </div>
            <ul>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;">institutional/business records and documents, such as, for example, University planning documents, strategic reports, accreditation reports, ordinary business correspondence, forms, and templates, or</li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;">works that are the result of improvements or modifications to works owned by the University.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Use of University Funds or Resources</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             If the creator of a copyrightable work makes exceptional non-ordinary use of the services of University non-faculty employees or University resources to create the work, he or she shall disclose the work to the University Intellectual Property Committee and assign ownership to the University. Examples of ordinary use include use of desktop computers, University libraries and limited secretarial or administrative resources, as well as ordinary use of other types of University resources readily and regularly available to faculty or staff working in his or her specific program, college, department or school (“University Department”) which do not significantly impact its operation Questions about what constitutes ordinary use should be directed to the Dean and disputes may be resolved by University Intellectual Property Committee. A University Department may request the University Intellectual Property Committee to provide additional clarification of the provisions of this section as it relates to the specific circumstances of their Department. University Departments may also propose, for evaluation and approval by the Committee, supplemental guidance regarding the definition of resources that are “readily and regularly available resources” for their faculty and staff.
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Works Otherwise Subject to Contractual Obligations</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Ownership of works developed pursuant to or under contract, grant, sponsorship or other arrangement with a third party shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such contract, agreement or grant. If no such terms and conditions are stated, then the works shall be subject to the terms of this Policy.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;
             <br>This Policy shall not be interpreted to limit the University's ability to meet its obligations under any contract, grant, or other arrangement with third parties. Copyrightable works that are subject to sponsored research agreements or other contractual obligations of the University shall be owned by the University, so that the University may satisfy its contractual obligations regarding licensing or assignment of ownership under such agreements.
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Syllabi and Courseware</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             In the interest of maintaining continuity of curriculum, the University retains all ownership rights in Syllabi and Courseware. Courseware means the embedded tools, technologies and content of digital teaching media, courses delivered by television, video, Internet or other media or technologies not yet developed, web publications and any other materials required for the delivery or teaching of a course. Courseware is not intended to include standard teaching materials unless embedded in syllabi or courseware.
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             If a faculty member leaves the University, he or she may continue to use at another academic or not-for-profit research institution for teaching, research and other noncommercial purposes, all Syllabi and Courseware he or she created at the University, except to the extent such use conflicts with the terms of applicable law, or the terms of an agreement with a third party. The University’s name shall not be used on such materials for any purpose other than the University’s copyright notice. The departing faculty member shall bear the cost of copying such materials.
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">License to University</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             The University shall receive a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty free license to perform, display, copy, modify and distribute works developed and owned by Authors during their term of employment with the University, for University’s academic and internal use without payment of royalties or other fees to the Author. The provisions of this section shall apply except to the extent otherwise required by law, such as, for example, the provisions of The California Art Preservation Act (California Civil Code Section 987), and except to the extent that the Author has informed the University in writing that such license is in conflict with contractual commitments with publishers or similar contractual arrangements.
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Student Purchases</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             Faculty often create materials in which they hold commercial interest and which might be used in courses or programs which the faculty is teaching or administering for the University. It is the policy of the University that faculty may require students to purchase materials in which the faculty or staff member holds a commercial interest for courses taught or programs administered by that faculty member. In this situation, however, the faculty member shall not make direct sales to students.
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Reconveyance of Copyright to Creator</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             When copyright is assigned to the University under this policy, the creator of the copyrighted material may make a request to the University Intellectual Property Committee that ownership be reconveyed back to the creator. Such a request can, at the discretion of the University Intellectual Property Committee, be granted if it does not: (i) violate any legal obligations of or to the University, (ii) limit appropriate University uses of the materials, (iii) create a real or potential conflict of interest for the creator, or (iv) otherwise conflict with&nbsp;University goals or principles. A request for reconveyance may be made by the creator at any time and the University Intellectual Property Committee shall respond not later than three months or its next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever is longer, and the timeframe is subject to extension by mutual agreement. &nbsp;
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Licensing by University</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             University ownership of any copyrightable work shall not constitute any promise, duty or undertaking on the part of the University with respect to the protection, enforcement or exploitation of such work.
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             Where the University receives royalties or income from copyrightable works it owns, the Author will receive thirty percent (30%) of the gross sum of any royalty or income paid in cash and received by the University after the University has recovered any costs and expenses associated with development, protection, licensing and enforcement of rights in the work.
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Administration of Policy</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             The application and interpretation of this Policy not resolved by the Dean, and questions of ownership, licensing, royalty or other matters pertaining to works covered by this Policy shall be resolved by the Intellectual Property Committee. Decisions of this panel shall be final and non-grievable under other internal processes.
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">

            </div>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">
             Waivers of the provisions of this policy may be granted by the Intellectual Property Committee, giving consideration among other things to University obligations to sponsors, University obligations under applicable law, whether the waiver would be in the best interest of technology transfer, whether the waiver would be in the best interest of the University and whether the waiver would result in a conflict of interest.
            </div>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Use of the University Name in Copyright Notices</h4>
            <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Explanation of Terms</h3>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Copyrightable Works</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Additionally, works may be registered with the United States Copyright Office using its official forms. Forms may be obtained from http://www.copyright.gov/forms to which questions concerning copyright notices and registration also may be addressed.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - Literary works such as books, pamphlets, brochures, journal articles, poems, manuals, memoranda, tests, computer programs, instructional material, databases, bibliographies
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - Musical works including any accompanying lyrics
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - Dramatic works, including any accompanying music

            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Scope of Copyright Protection</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, process, or concept, but only protects the work in which it may be embodied. For example, copyright protects a written description of a manufacturing process. However, copyright only prevents unauthorized copying of the written description; the ideas behind the process described are not protected by copyright. They could be protected by some other means, such as patent or trade secret.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;
            </div>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Subject to the exceptions and limitations provided for in the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, and display or perform the work publicly. Ownership of copyright is distinct from the ownership of any material object in which the work may be embodied. For example, purchase of a film on DVD grants ownership of the DVD medium but not ownership rights to the underlying content. The term of copyright in works created on or after January 1, 1978, is the life of the author plus seventy years. Copyright in works-for-hire is for ninety-five years from the date of first publication or one hundred twenty years from creation, whichever period first expires.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Intellectual Property Committee</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Intellectual Property Committee shall consist of the Chancellor or his or her designee, the Chief Operating Officer, or his or her designee, and a Faculty Senate Designee.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>

           <h3 class="header" role="button" tabindex="0"><span class="show"></span><span class="hide"></span> Export Control Policy </h3>
           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Policy for Chapman University faculty, staff, student employees, and courtesy affiliates who work with, or have access to, export-controlled technical data, items, information, materials or equipment.</p>
            <h3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>The University is committed to supporting research and complying with U.S. export controls. No University faculty, staff, or student may engage in any activity, or commit the University to engage in any activity, that violates U.S. export control laws and regulations.&nbsp;This Policy applies to Chapman University faculty, staff, student employees and courtesy affiliates who work with, or have access to, export-controlled technical data, items, information, materials or equipment.</p>
            <h3>REASON FOR THE POLICY</h3>
            <p>Several federal agencies have implemented export control regulations that may relate to research conducted at Chapman University. &nbsp;The most common export control regulations affecting university research and scholarly activities are described below:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>A. Export Administration Regulations (EAR)  </strong><br><br>The US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), administers and enforces the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774), or “EAR,” which regulate the export of “dual-use” items listed on the <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/commerce-control-list-ccl">Commerce Control List</a>. These items include goods and related technology, including technical data and technical assistance, which are designed for commercial purposes, but which could have military applications, such as computers, aircraft, and pathogens..&nbsp; BIS uses the term "technology" when referring to information about the goods on the Commerce Control List.<br><br><strong>B. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</strong> <br><br>Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) administers and enforces trade, anti-terrorism, narcotics, human rights and other national security and foreign policy based sanctions prohibiting the provision of anything of value, either tangible or intangible, to <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx">sanctioned countries</a>, organizations, or individuals. The OFAC regulations (31 CFR Parts 500-599) provide OFAC with broad authority to block or interdict "prohibited transactions" involving restricted destinations or parties.<br><br><strong>C. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)  </strong><br><br>The US Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers and enforces the “ITAR” regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130) and is responsible for items and information inherently military in design, purpose, or use. Referred to as "defense articles" and “defense services,” such items are found on the US Munitions List, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=70e390c181ea17f847fa696c47e3140a&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt22.1.121">22 CFR 121</a>. Spacecraft and satellites, even if not for military use, are on the Munitions List, along with their associated systems and related equipment. Information related to Defense Articles is referred to as "technical data."</p>
            <p>Penalties for export control violations are substantial, including significant fines, debarment from participation in federal contracting, loss of export privileges, and in some cases imprisonment.</p>
            <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
            <p><strong>Export</strong>:&nbsp; An actual shipment or transmission of items, services, or technical data subject to either the EAR or the ITAR out of the United States, or the release of technology or software source code (EAR), or technical data (ITAR), to a non-U.S. person in the United States. Technology, software, or technical data is “released” for export through:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Visual inspection by a foreign national of U.S. origin equipment and facilities</li>
             <li>Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad</li>
             <li>Transfer or shipment via any means (physical or electronic) to a foreign entity</li>
             <li>Provision of a service, or the application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Deemed Export</strong>:&nbsp; Release or transmission of information or technology subject to export control to any foreign national in the U.S., including graduate students and training fellows. Such a release of information is considered an export to the foreign national’s home country.<br><br><strong>Defense Article</strong>:&nbsp; Any item or technical data designated in the ITAR's United States Munitions List (USML), including any technical data recorded or stored in any physical form, models, mock-ups, or other items that reveal technical data directly relating to a “defense article” listed in the USML.<br><br><strong>Defense Services</strong>:&nbsp; Furnishing assistance (including training) anywhere (inside the United States or abroad) to foreign nationals in connection with the design, development, engineering, manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, maintenance, modification, operation, demilitarization, destruction, processing, or use of defense articles; or furnishing ITAR-controlled “technical data” to non-US persons anywhere, requires authorization from the State Department.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Dual-use</strong>:&nbsp; Items that have both commercial and defense application. Items subject to the EAR are often referred to as "dual-use.”<br><br><strong>Export Controls</strong>: Refers to the scheme of federal laws (EAR, ITAR and OFAC regulations) regulating the shipment or transfer, by whatever&nbsp;means, of&nbsp;controlled&nbsp;items, software, technology, or services to foreign nationals or outside of the U.S.<br><br><strong>Export license</strong>:&nbsp; A written authorization provided by the appropriate governing regulatory authority detailing the specific terms and conditions under which export or re-export of export controlled items is allowed. Export licenses can take up to a year to receive.<br><br><strong>Fundamental Research</strong>:&nbsp; Basic or applied research in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific community, is excluded from export controls.</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Under the EAR (15 CFR §734.8), university research normally will be considered as fundamental research unless the university or its researchers accept sponsor restrictions on the publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or activity. The EAR specifically permits limited prepublication reviews by research sponsors to prevent the inadvertent divulging of proprietary information provided to the researcher by the sponsor or to ensure that publication will not compromise the patent rights of the sponsor.</li>
             <li>Under the ITAR (22 CFR §120.11(8)), only research at accredited institutions of higher learning in the U.S. can qualify as fundamental. University research will not qualify as fundamental research if: (1) the university or its researchers accept any restrictions on the publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or activity; or (2) the research is federally funded and specific access and dissemination controls protecting information resulting from the research have been accepted by the university or the researcher.<br><br><strong>Technology Control Plan (TCP)</strong>: &nbsp;A Tool to safeguard ITAR, EAR, and other restricted material. The TCP establishes a security plan and identifies responsible parties.&nbsp; The TCP must be approved by Vice President for Research before restricted technology can be brought onto campus.<br><br>The TCP can be used to set forth the procedures necessary to protect certain export-controlled materials and technology/technical data from inadvertent transfer and access (oral, visual, electronic, physical, etc.) by unauthorized personnel, including non-U.S. persons. These procedures include physical and information security, procurement, shipping/transporting, personnel screening, training and awareness, and compliance assessment. The TCP can also be used to control the disposition of research materials and technical data when the project is terminated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>POLICY</h3>
            <p>The University is committed to complying with U.S. export controls. Faculty, staff, and students involved in research and academic projects that are subject to export controls must follow the requirements that are appropriate for the roles they serve.&nbsp; Examples of export controlled activities are identified on the <a href="../integrity/index.aspx">Research Integrity website</a>. Individuals are responsible for reviewing the materials on the University's&nbsp;<a href="../integrity/index.aspx">Research Integrity website</a>&nbsp;and consulting Office of Research when export controls apply. No University faculty, staff, or student may engage in any activity, or commit the University to engage in any activity, that violates U.S. export control laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Most research conducted at Chapman University falls under the definition of fundamental research. The conduct, products, and results of fundamental research conducted at U.S. institutions of higher education are generally excluded from federal “deemed export” controls in accordance with National Security Decision Directive 189 (commonly known as the “fundamental research exclusion”). Research conducted in foreign locations or with publication restrictions does not fall under the fundamental research exclusion.</p>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Policy for the administration of facilities and administrative (F&amp;A) costs associated with managing sponsored projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Background on Facilities and Administrative (F&amp;A) Costs</strong></p>
            <p>Previously known as indirect cost, F&amp;A cost is the University’s recovery for overhead and other indirect expenses associated with managing sponsored projects.&nbsp; The University absorbs certain costs in administering sponsored programs but certain expenses cannot be specifically identified with a particular sponsored program or directly charged to it.&nbsp; Examples of these expenses include general office supplies, utilities, and most general administrative assistance.&nbsp; These administrative expenses are therefore reimbursed as part of the F&amp;A cost. The F&amp;A cost is allocated as a percentage of either a Salary &amp; Wages (S&amp;W), Total Direct Costs (TDC), or Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) base. For federal awards, the Financial Services negotiates a new rate agreement every four to five years with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>F&amp;A costs promote research and scholarly activity at Chapman University. Therefore, unless the sponsor restricts the rate in writing, or there is a documented waiver by an authorized individual(s), Principal Investigators (PIs) must include F&amp;A costs in their proposal at the current negotiated rate so that the University can be reasonably reimbursed for the indirect costs associated with managing the sponsored program.</p>
            <p><strong>Distribution of F&amp;A Recovery</strong></p>
            <p>In order to stimulate further research and to reimburse the unit that generated the F&amp;A recovery, the University has elected to allocate the F&amp;A recovery in the following manner.&nbsp; The allocation will be made on an individual grant basis, depending on the actual amount recovered from the sponsor.</p>

            <p><strong>Distribution Process</strong></p>
            <p>For proper internal control and budgeting, the F&amp;A recovery will be allocated in accordance to the following procedures:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Availability</u></p>
            <p>For each distribution area, the Office of Research will create an account under the unrestricted fund as a University-designated unrestricted account.&nbsp; Unspent funds will carry forward from fiscal year to fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Burden of F&amp;A Cost</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Office of Research will burden each sponsored program with the appropriate F&amp;A cost based on negotiated rates or other predetermined rates on a monthly basis.&nbsp; When F&amp;A recovery is received or accrued, portions will be properly transferred into their respective unrestricted accounts.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Specification of Appropriate College/School </u></p>
            <p>In the case where grants are managed through a Center or Institute, the College or School that the main Principal Investigator holds their faculty appointment will receive the Dean portion (10%) of the F&amp;A. If a Principal Investigator has no affiliation with a College or School, then the Dean portion will remain with the Center or Institute.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Specific Usage of Funds</strong></p>
            <p>All funds should be expended for University-related purposes in accordance with existing University policies and procedures.&nbsp; These funds are intended to support research-related costs, and a detailed listing of research related costs is provided in the next section.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>PI’s Allocation</u></p>
            <p>The Office of Research will create an individual project code to assist the PI in tracking their F&amp;A research fund allocation.&nbsp; The PI should adhere to all University policies and procedures when using these funds.&nbsp; These funds must be used for research-related costs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If the PI leaves the University, these allocated funds will be forfeited and returned to the University’s Vice President for Research F&amp;A account.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Dean’s Allocation</u></p>
            <p>The Dean’s allocation will be used under the discretion of the Dean, provided that consideration is given to research-related costs. These funds could be used to assist with cost sharing (also known as matching) and adjunct instruction costs required when PIs experience course reduction in order to complete a sponsored research project.&nbsp; When using these funds for cost sharing, Dean’s should follow the existing procedures issued by the Financial Services and the Office of Research, in order to ensure that the cost sharing expenditures are properly documented for reporting and future reference.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Dean may elect to give a portion of the F&amp;A to the Departments or Units within their School or College. The department’s allocation will be used under the discretion of the department heads, provided that consideration is given to research related costs.&nbsp; These funds could be used to seed research projects, to support research travel and other activities, and/or to cover research related administrative costs such as general office supplies, phone, postage and other administrative needs.&nbsp; They will also be used to cover any overdrafts on sponsored projects.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Director’s Allocation</u></p>
            <p>The Director’s allocation should be used for a variety of research related purposes including the administrative support of pre and post award functions for the Center/Institute, costs associated with general operations of the Center/Institute and potentially any bridge funding of research personnel.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Office of Research </u></p>
            <p>The Office of Research allocation will be used by their respective units with the intention of supporting and advancing research across campus and support of central administrative expenses for sponsored programs and compliance. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Examples of appropriate uses of F&amp;A allocations are described below:</u></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Operations support: Clerical salaries, postage, phones, etc. needed to manage the project but for which the federal sponsor expects F&amp;A to pay.</li>
             <li>Bridge funding: Salaries and benefits for key personnel to retain them between grants, as well as supplies, travel and clerical support to develop proposals for new funding.</li>
             <li>Sponsor-required cost sharing: Costs to meet sponsor-required percentages or dollar amounts for cost sharing as documented in proposals or grant agreements.</li>
             <li>Allowable project costs: Salaries for research assistants, chemical supplies, travel for grant purposes, or other types of support approved but not fully-funded by the sponsor.</li>
             <li>Non-allowable or non-allocable but related project costs: Items such as participant food, promotional items, office equipment, boat rental fees, space rent, etc. that the sponsor does not allow but that are needed to conduct or enhance the project.</li>
             <li>Project development costs: Pilot projects; proposal writing; proposal typing/editing; travel to conferences and/or to meet with sponsors; expenses to host sponsors, prospective partners, or influential project supporters; specialized equipment, and workshops leading to proposal submissions.</li>
             <li>Research faculty recruitment and initial support: Salaries/equipment for new faculty or research faculty bringing grants with them from another institution; salaries for promising research associates or new faculty with the expectation they will write proposals and obtain future grants.</li>
             <li>Research center/institute support: Shared administrative/executive assistants, technicians, equipment purchases or maintenance, and other support for groups of principal investigators.</li>
             <li>Personnel support for sponsored projects and compliance: support positions for research administration support of pre and post award management and all areas of research compliance (i.e., human subjects, animal use, conflict of interest, export controls, research misconduct).</li>

           <div class="content editableContent">
             Sets forth the structure of the Human Research Protection Program at Chapman University and describes the authority and responsibilities of individual researchers, the IO and the IRB in implementing the program. 
            <h3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>Chapman University fosters a research environment that promotes respect for the rights, safety, and welfare of individuals recruited for or participating in research conducted by members of the University.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>REASON FOR THE POLICY</h3>
            <p>This policy exists to responsibly govern human subjects research at Chapman University.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>POLICY</h3>
            <p>All employees and students of the University who are conducting human subject research are required to comply with Chapman requirements, procedures, and protocols of the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP). The HRPP includes mechanisms to establish, monitor, evaluate and continually improve the protection of human research participants, educate investigators and research staff about their ethical responsibility to protect research participants, and, when appropriate, intervene in research and respond to concerns of research participants.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The University's HRPP is established under and in accordance with the laws, regulations, and principles listed below regarding the protection of human subjects. The University and its employees and students will adhere to these laws, regulations, and principles concerning human subject research:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy and regulations at 45 CFR part 46, also known as the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects</a> or the&nbsp;<strong><em>"Common Rule"</em></strong>;</p>
            <p>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations related to clinical trials and human subject protections at <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html">21 CFR Parts 51 and 56</a> (collectively referred to in this document as the&nbsp;<em><strong>"FDA Regulations"</strong></em>);&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The principles (i.e., respect for persons, beneficence, and justice) set forth in the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html">Ethical&nbsp;Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research</a> (collectively referred to in this document as the “<em><strong>Belmont Report</strong></em>”);</p>
            <p>Other federal regulations implementing the Common Rule that apply when carrying out studies sponsored by those agencies; and</p>
            <p>All state and local laws and regulations governing human subject research, including California’s requirements for the protection of human subjects as provided in the Protection of Human Subjects in Medical Experimentation Act, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article">CA Health and Safety Code, Section 24170-</a><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article">24179.5.</a></p>
            <p>Federal and state regulations governing the administration of controlled substances or regulated devices.</p>
            <p><strong>The Institutional Official</strong></p>
            <p>The President of Chapman University has the power and authority to designate an individual within the University to serve as the Institutional Official (IO), who is legally authorized to act for the University, obligates Chapman to the terms of the Federal Wide Assurance, and is responsible for carrying out the HRPP. The person designated as the IO must meet qualifications including being an employee of the University, being authorized to act and speak for the University as a whole, and ensuring that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will effectively fulfill its research oversight function. The President has designated the Vice President for Research as the IO, and the Chapman IRB as the body within the University that has jurisdiction over all human subject research conducted at or in connection with the University.</p>
            <p>The HRPP operates under the guidance and direction of the IO and the IRB and is administered through and by the Office of Research.</p>
            <p><strong>IRB Authority</strong></p>
            <p>The IRB is responsible for conducting initial and continuing reviews and providing oversight for all research activities involving the use of human subjects performed by agents or employees and students of the University, regardless of the funding source for the study. No researcher may conduct human subject research without the approval of the Chapman IRB or an outside IRB that Chapman agrees to rely upon.</p>
            <p>The IRB has authority to grant approval for studies involving human subjects, to require modifications to secure approval, to disapprove research, to suspend or terminate approval pursuant to these policies, to observe or have a third party observe consent processes or the conduct of research, or to grant an exemption pursuant to this policy. Studies involving human subjects that have been approved by an IRB may be subject to further review by the University (e.g., when data safety plans are needed, controlled substances or regulated devices are used, or where there is a potential conflict of interest). The President or the IO may disapprove a protocol that the IRB has approved; however, neither may approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.</p>
            <p><strong>Setting IRB Policy</strong></p>
            <p>The IRB Chair and IRB committee share authority over IRB policy in collaboration with the IO. Any member of the IRB may at any time suggest revisions to the IRB policy through the IRB Chair. It is also expected that the IRB policies will be amended when changes in federal regulations occur. The IRB Chair may revise IRB policy in consultation with the IO as needed.</p>
            <p>This HRPP policy may only be revised upon recommendation by the IO and with the approval of the President, in accordance with Chapman’s Policy Development and Publication Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation of Risk by the IRB</strong></p>
            <p>The IRB is responsible for evaluating the potential risks of a study and weighing the probability of the risk occurring and the magnitude of harm that may result. The IRB will not approve research where the risks are judged unreasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits.</p>
            <p>The IRB is also responsible for evaluating Chapman’s ability to protect the human subject's safety, rights, and welfare for studies that involve elevated or significant risk. At this time, because Chapman does not have the appropriate medical or hospital facilities, in vivo human testing of drugs and biologics cannot be conducted at the Orange or Rinker campuses. Similarly, studies using FDA-regulated devices deemed by the FDA or the Chapman IRB to be of significant risk will not be undertaken at Chapman. Such studies may only be conducted off-site with a collaborator at a medical institution with adequate facilities, significant clinical trial experience, and appropriate medical expertise, or by contracting the services of a professional clinical research organization. Chapman must enter into a formal agreement with the IRB of the clinical research organization or collaborating medical institution, agreeing to rely on the external organization’s or institution’s IRB review of the protocol. This policy will be reviewed from time to time and revised accordingly based on Chapman’s ability to support these studies on campus.</p>
            <p><strong>Oversight by the IRB</strong></p>
            <ul>
             <li>Human subject research that is subject to the authority of the Chapman IRB includes:</li>
             <li>Human subjects research conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent for Chapman in connection with their institutional responsibilities;</li>
             <li>Human subject research conducted by Chapman students;</li>
             <li>Human subject research conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of Chapman using any property or facility of the University or using any University’s name or resources to contact or identify human subjects; and</li>
             <li>Human subject research was conducted at the Orange or Rinker campuses by a non-Chapman employee or agent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Institutions and individuals who are not employees or students of Chapman may not rely upon the Chapman IRB unless there is a written agreement including compliance with the Chapman IRB policies and procedures, signed by an authorized official of Chapman.</p>

           <h3 class="header" role="button" tabindex="0"><span class="show"></span><span class="hide"></span> Conflict of Interest In Human Research </h3>
           <div class="content editableContent">
            <h3><strong>POLICY</strong></h3>
            <p>A conflict of interest in research refers to situations in which a financial or other commitment may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, a researcher’s professional judgment in the design, conduct, or&nbsp;reporting of research. A conflict of interest depends on the situation, not the individual's character or actions.<br><br>The welfare and safety of research participants are paramount. All conflicts must be eliminated or managed to ensure that the researcher’s interest does not compromise the welfare of participants or the integrity of the data. A conflict management plan, approved by the Conflict of Interest Committee, with terms and conditions appropriate to the conflict, must be implemented to ensure the integrity of Chapman research, appropriate protections for participants, and compliance with University policies.<br><br>&nbsp;Chapman has instituted a rebuttable presumption that research personnel involved in the oversight, design, participant recruitment, informed consent process, data analysis, or reporting of results for a human research protocol cannot have an outside financial interest in an entity whose interest could be affected by the research. In other words, the default position is that participation in human research by financially conflicted research personnel is not allowed. However, there may be compelling circumstances in which conflicted research personnel would be permitted to be involved in the study. In these cases, the management strategies for the involvement of conflicted researchers must be carefully adjusted to the level of anticipated risk to the study participants and the integrity of the data.&nbsp; The rebuttable presumption does not apply to intellectual property that has not yet been commercialized or where commercialization is not imminent.</p>
            <h3><strong>Disclosure of Outside Activities</strong></h3>
            <p>As part of a research study, all Chapman researchers must identify any outside interest (paid or unpaid) for themselves, their spouse/domestic partner, or their dependent children (“close family members”) that may be related to the proposed research conducted at Chapman or using Chapman resources (i.e., funding, personnel, students, or facilities).&nbsp; Members of the study team are responsible for proactively disclosing to the IRB any new outside relationships that may have an impact on the study until data analysis is complete and the study is closed with the IRB.</p>
            <p>Examples of conflicts include but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>The project results could be relevant to the development, manufacturing, or improvement of products or services of the entity in which the researcher or their close family member has a financial interest. </li>
             <li>The project results could validate a treatment approach that is the same or similar or competitive to the approach developed or offered by the entity in which the researcher or their close family member volunteers consulting time (i.e., has an unpaid commitment). <br><br>The researcher or their close family member is an officer of a company manufacturing,&nbsp;commercializing, or licensing a device, procedure, or other product used in the study. </li>
             <li>The researcher or their close family member has a financial interest in an entity that funds or participates in the project. <br><br>The researcher or their close family member has an unpaid outside relationship with the entity donating research data or other materials that are the focus of the research project.</li>
             <li>The study is self-funded by a researcher or their close family member.<br><br>The study focuses on the efficacy of a device, product, or material developed by a researcher or a close family member and the results of the study will be used to launch a new company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The IRB will then evaluate whether the management plan is sufficient to protect the rights and welfare of the participants. If the study proceeds, the IRB will specify the acceptable language for the informed consent documents.&nbsp; If the IRB deems the management plan insufficient to protect the rights of the participants, the matter will be referred back to the Conflict of Interest Committee and the researcher.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

           <h3 class="header" role="button" tabindex="0"><span class="show"></span><span class="hide"></span> Integrity in Research Policy </h3>
           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Outlines Chapman University's general policy and principles for adhering to the highest standards of intellectual honesty, and outlines the procedures for handling allegations of misconduct.</p>
            <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <h4>A. Statement of Philosophy</h4>
            <p>Integrity in research is central to the academic enterprise. All individuals engaged in research at Chapman University are responsible for adhering to the highest standards of intellectual honesty and integrity. Faculty and other supervisors of research activities have a responsibility to set an example and to create an environment which encourages absolute intellectual integrity. Open communication, an emphasis on quality of research and publications, appropriate supervision of personnel, concern for the health and safety of human and animal subjects, maintenance of accurate and detailed records of research procedures and results, and suitable assignment of credit and responsibility for research and publications are all essential for fostering intellectual honesty and integrity in research.</p>
            <h4>B. Environment of Integrity</h4>
            <p>Chapman University is committed to promoting a climate of integrity in research. To this end, the University encourages the reporting of any incident of detected or perceived misconduct in research and will take prompt and deliberate action to investigate and address allegations of misconduct, based on the following principles:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Institutional and academic responsibility for self-regulation;</li>
             <li>Mechanisms to protect the rights of the accused, the interests of those making an accusation, and the public interest;</li>
             <li>The highest degree of confidentiality compatible with an effective response and responsible reporting requirements; and</li>
             <li>Precautions against conflicts of interest</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>C. Scope of the Policy</h4>
            <p>This Policy applies to acts or practices that deviate significantly from those commonly accepted within the scholarly or scientific communities for proposing, conducting, reporting, or performing research. Such acts and practices include but are not limited to: Dishonesty in Presentation and Publication, Deliberate and Serious Violation of Regulation, Fabrication, Falsification, Failure to Report Unethical Research Activities, and Plagiarism. This Policy does not apply to unintentional errors or honest differences in the interpretation or judgment of data, nor does this Policy and its procedures apply to authorship or collaboration disputes.</p>
            <p>This Policy and the associated procedures apply to all research activities conducted under the auspices of Chapman University, whether or not they are externally funded. This Policy applies to any individual holding an appointment from, or affiliated with Chapman University, such as faculty members, post-doctoral fellows, trainees, technicians, guest researchers, staff members, graduate students and undergraduate students, nonemployees, regardless of where the research is or was performed or whether they receive pay from the University.</p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of individuals applying for research funding or engaged in research at Chapman University to inform themselves of Chapman's policies relating to research and to inform themselves of the policies and procedures of the agencies funding his or her activities. Copies of relevant policies should be available on the website of the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs Administration and on the website of the Office of Human Resources. Each new researcher should be referred to relevant policy statements. However, all persons engaged in research at Chapman University are ultimately responsible for conducting their activities in accordance with all applicable external and internal rules and regulations.</p>
            <h4>D. Statute of Limitations</h4>
            <p>This Policy and its procedures apply only to allegations of misconduct reported to an institutional official within five (5) years of the alleged act, except in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Where the research involved in the allegation is funded by an external agency that stipulates a longer statute of limitations, the longer statute of limitation shall pertain. For instance, the statute of limitations for research funded by the Public Health Service (PHS) is six (6) years. All persons engaged in funded research at Chapman University are responsible for knowing the limitation period mandated by their funding agency.</li>
             <li>Where the research involved in the allegation has been cited or republished by the individual against whom the allegation has been made, the five-year limitation period begins at the time of the last citation or publication.</li>
             <li>Where the research involved in the allegation poses a threat to public health or safety, there is no statute of limitations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>E. Revisions to the Policy</h4>
            <p>The University's Compliance Committee shall assume responsibility for updating this Policy. All substantive changes to the Policy are subject to approval by the Board of Trustees, except when such changes are mandated by federal funding agencies or applicable law.</p>
            <h3>II. DEFINITIONS</h3>
            <p><strong>Administrator</strong>: The person who is apprised of the allegation of misconduct and is responsible for conducting an Initial Assessment and determining whether a Preliminary Inquiry and a Formal Investigation are warranted.</p>
            <p><strong>Complainant</strong>: The individual bringing forth an allegation of misconduct. It is assumed that the Complainant makes the allegation in Good Faith, even if the allegation is proven to be a misunderstanding, misinterpretation or miscalculation of the facts, and that no misconduct was committed.</p>
            <p><strong>Complaint Reviewer</strong>: The individual(s) charged with conducting a Preliminary Inquiry of an allegation of misconduct. The Complaint Reviewer is appointed by the Administrator.</p>
            <p><strong>Dishonesty in Presentation and Publication</strong>: Knowingly presenting material or publishing articles that will mislead listeners or readers, e.g., misrepresenting data (particularly its originality); adding the names of other authors without permission or authors who have not earned the credit; exerting pressure to join the list of authors when the level of contribution did not warrant inclusion; citing unpublished papers or scholarly work without permission, or including inadequate footnote or endnote attributions so that readers cannot tell who produced which data; publishing the same material more than once without&nbsp;identification of prior publication; serving as a coauthor of a research paper or article without reviewing the material to be published. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Deliberate and Serious Violation of Regulation</strong>: Deliberate or reckless failure to adhere to safe research practices or to receive the approval required for work under research regulations of federal, state, local, or university agencies; deliberate misuse of research funds.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence</strong>: Any document, tangible item, or testimony offered or obtained that tends to prove or disprove an alleged fact.</p>
            <p><strong>Fabrication</strong>: Making up data or results and recording or reporting them.</p>
            <p><strong>Falsification</strong>: Manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure to Report Unethical Research Practices: </strong>Covering up or otherwise failing to report misconduct in research as set forth in this Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Formal Investigation</strong>: The formal examination and evaluation of relevant evidence to determine if misconduct in research has taken place, to evaluate its seriousness, and, if possible, to determine responsibility. A Formal Investigation may also be necessary to determine the extent of any adverse effects resulting from the misconduct and any necessary remedial or follow-up actions (e.g., publications requiring retraction). The Investigation Committee is responsible for conducting the Formal Investigation.</p>
            <p><strong>Good Faith</strong>: As applied to a Complainant or witness, Good Faith means having a belief in the truth of one's allegations or testimony that a reasonable person in the Complainant's or witness's position could have based on the information known to the Complainant or witness at the time. An allegation or testimony is not in Good Faith if made with knowing or reckless disregard for information that would negate the allegation or testimony. Good Faith, as applied to a Complaint Reviewer or Investigation Committee member, means impartially carrying out the duties assigned for the purpose of helping an institution meet its responsibilities under this part.

Misconduct in research does not include unintentional error or honest differences in the interpretation or judgment of data.</p>
            <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong>: Taking credit for someone else's work and ideas, stealing others' results or methods, copying the writing of others without acknowledgment, or otherwise taking credit falsely. This may also include taking or releasing the data of others which were given in the expectation of confidentiality (e.g., appropriating ideas from submitted grant or contract proposals, or manuscripts for publication when one is a reviewer for granting agencies or journals).</p>
            <p><strong>Preliminary Inquiry</strong>: Information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation of misconduct warrants a Formal Investigation. A Preliminary Inquiry is not intended to determine conclusively if wrongdoing has occurred, or to determine guilt or innocence. The Complaint Reviewer is responsible for conducting the Preliminary Inquiry.</p>
            <p><strong>Preponderance of the Evidence</strong>: Proof by information that, compared with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not.</p>
            <p><strong>Research</strong>: A systematic experiment, study, evaluation, demonstration or survey designed to develop or contribute to general knowledge (basic research) or specific knowledge (applied research) by establishing, discovering, developing, elucidating or confirming information about, or the underlying mechanism relating to, matters to be studied. : A systematic experiment, study, evaluation, demonstration or survey designed to develop or contribute to general knowledge (basic research) or specific knowledge (applied research) by establishing, discovering, developing, elucidating or confirming information about, or the underlying mechanism relating to, matters to be studied.</p>
            <p><strong>Research Records</strong>: Record of data or results that embody the facts resulting from research activity, including but not limited to: research proposals; laboratory records, including both physical and electronic data; computers and scientific equipment used; progress reports; abstracts; theses; oral presentations; internal reports; journal articles and the like. This also includes documents and materials of research fact provided by the Respondent at any point during the Preliminary Inquiry and Formal Investigation. It does not include notations, interpretations or analyses performed by the Complainant in support of his/her allegation of misconduct.</p>
            <p><strong>Respondent</strong>: The individual accused of misconduct in research.</p>
            <p><strong>Retaliation</strong>: Adverse actions of any kind taken against Complainants, Respondents, witnesses, Administrators, Complaint Reviewers, or Investigation Committee members because of their status as Complainant, Respondent, witness, Administrator, Complaint Reviewer, or Investigation Committee member. This definition does not include University personnel actions that may be taken against individuals to protect the integrity of the research and safety of any research subjects or research participants.</p>
            <p><strong>Spoliation</strong>: The destruction, mutilation or alteration of records or materials unfavorable to the party causing the spoliation.</p>
            <h3>III. GENERAL POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES</h3>
            <h4>A. Responsibility to Report Misconduct</h4>
            <p>It is the responsibility of University faculty, staff and students to report any incident of misconduct in Good Faith and in accordance with the definitions and terms of this Policy. Individuals who are unsure whether a suspected incident constitutes misconduct in research are encouraged to discuss the matter with the Vice President of Research, which may include discussing it anonymously and/or hypothetically. Allegations of misconduct originating from any source (student, staff, faculty, or an individual outside of the Chapman University community) shall be pursued in a timely manner and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
            <h4>B. Protecting Complainants</h4>
            <p>The identity of the individual filing the allegation of misconduct ("Complainant") will be protected, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the rights of the Respondent in accordance with University policy. If the Complainant has directly observed unethical behavior, he or she should be prepared to testify to that observation if it is necessary to establish that such behavior has occurred. If the initial report of misconduct is oral, it must be put in written form before a Preliminary Inquiry can proceed.</p>
            <h4>C. Discouraging Negative Actions</h4>
            <p>The University has zero tolerance for retaliation. Respondents are free to defend themselves against allegations without fear of reprisal for such defense. Malicious allegations on the part of a Complainant will be treated as separate violations of this Policy, incurring appropriate disciplinary action. If it is determined that the allegation was made frivolously, vindictively, maliciously, or with knowledge that the allegation was not true, serious consequences may occur for the Complainant, including dismissal/expulsion, if an employee, student, or faculty member, and/or civil action. Retaliation on the part of the Respondent shall itself be treated as a violation of this Policy, incurring appropriate disciplinary action.</p>
            <h4>D. Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>The University expects all individuals involved in an allegation of misconduct to maintain the highest degree of confidentiality compatible with an effective response and responsible reporting requirements. Administrators should use written confidentiality agreements or other mechanism to ensure that appropriate confidentiality is maintained.<strong>1</strong></p>
            <h4>E. Notification to Funding Agencies</h4>
            <p>Upon receiving an allegation of misconduct that involves externally funded research, the University shall make timely notification to the funding agency, as required by that agency. For instance, the University shall notify the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) whenever a credible allegation involves research funded by the Public Health Service (PHS). The Vice President of Research, shall be responsible for notifying external funding agencies.</p>
            <h4>F. Standard of Proof</h4>
            <p>The standard of proof used to evaluate an allegation of misconduct and make findings in the Initial Assessment, Preliminary Inquiry, and Formal Investigation phases is Preponderance of the Evidence. The standard of proof used in the Final Decision phase is Preponderance of the Evidence. The burden of proof for making a finding of misconduct in research rests with the University or with the integrity oversight arm of the funding agency. The individual accused of misconduct ("Respondent") has the burden of proof for all affirmative defenses.</p>
            <h3>IV. SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT</h3>
            <h4>A. Overview</h4>
            <p>An allegation of misconduct is considered in phases. An allegation that is found not to warrant further response in any one of these phases does not proceed to the next phase. The phases through which an allegation may pass are, in the order in which they occur:</p>
            <ol>
             <li>The Initial Assessment, performed by the Administrator;</li>
             <li>The Preliminary Inquiry, performed by the Complaint Reviewer;</li>
             <li>The Formal Investigation, performed by the Investigation Committee; and</li>
             <li>The Final Decision, performed by the Vice President of Research (in most cases).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>B. Reporting Misconduct</h4>
            <p>Allegations of misconduct shall be reported to various institutional officials, depending on the institutional status of the Respondent. The institutional official shall serve as the Administrator of the allegation, as defined in this Policy. In the case of a potential conflict of interest between the Administrator and the Respondent, or in the case of uncertainty as to the appropriate Administrator (e.g., a Respondent with a dual appointment), the allegation will be referred to the Vice President of Research, who may serve as the Administrator or may appoint some other person to serve as the Administrator for purposes of the complaint.</p>

            <p>In most instances, the Vice President of Research is responsible for ruling on potential conflicts of interest, notifying external funding agencies, and rendering a final decision following a Formal Investigation.</p>
            <h3>V. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT</h3>
            <h4>A. Purpose</h4>
            <p>Upon receiving an allegation of misconduct, the appropriate Administrator will immediately assess the allegation to determine whether it is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of misconduct may be identified, and whether the allegation falls within the definition of misconduct as outlined in this Policy.</p>
            <h4>B. Timeline</h4>
            <p>The Initial Assessment should be concluded within seven (7) calendar days of the day the Administrator receives the allegation.</p>
            <h4>C. Notification</h4>
            <p>Upon receiving an allegation of misconduct, the Administrator must make a Good Faith effort to notify the Respondent in writing that an allegation of misconduct has been made, if the Respondent is known. This notification shall include a brief but specific description of the complaint and shall refer the Respondent to this Policy. If the allegation involves research funded by external agencies, the Administrator shall also notify the Vice President of Research.</p>
            <h4>D. Examination of Evidence</h4>
            <p>On the same day the Administrator notifies the Respondent of the allegation, the Administrator shall obtain custody of, inventory, and sequester all research records and evidence needed to conduct the Initial Assessment. In conducting the Initial Assessment, the Administrator need not interview the Complainant, Respondent, or other witnesses, or gather data beyond any that may have been submitted with the allegation, except as necessary to determine whether the allegation is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of misconduct may be identified.</p>
            <h4>E. Outcome of the Initial Assessment</h4>
            <p>If the Administrator finds that the complaint (1) does not fall within the scope of misconduct under this Policy, or (2) is not sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of misconduct may be identified, the Administrator shall inform the Respondent, the Complainant, and the Vice President of Research (in the case of allegations involving external funds) that the allegation will not be investigated further and shall prepare a memorandum to be kept in the Administrator's file.</p>
            <p>If the Administrator finds that the complaint (1) falls within the scope of misconduct under this Policy, and (2) is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of misconduct may be identified, the Administrator shall discuss the Preliminary Inquiry and Formal Investigation procedures with the Complainant, where possible. If, pursuant to this discussion, the Administrator determines that the allegation does not concern misconduct within the scope this Policy, or is not sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of misconduct may be identified (e.g., the Complainant is unable to provide information of a specific incident or act that would constitute misconduct, or the Complainant is unprepared to testify to the misconduct and such a testimony would constitute the only evidence of the misconduct), the Administrator shall inform the Respondent, the Complainant, and the Vice President of Research (in the case of allegations involving external funds) that the allegation will not be investigated further and shall prepare a memorandum to be kept in the Administrator's file.</p>
            <p>If, pursuant to the discussion with the Complainant, the Administrator is confirmed in his or her determination of the merit of the allegation, the Administrator shall notify the Respondent and initiate a Preliminary Inquiry. If the Complainant withdraws or otherwise fails to support the allegation (e.g., choosing not to proffer a written allegation) but the Administrator believes there is sufficient cause to pursue the allegation, the Administrator may initiate a Preliminary Inquiry; in such a case there is no Complainant for the purposes of this Policy.</p>
            <h4>F. Student Respondents</h4>
            <p>If the Administrator determines that an allegation of misconduct against a student Respondent warrants a Preliminary Inquiry yet also determines that the alleged misconduct: (1) was not supported by external funds; and (2) was not published or presented for external audiences, then the Administrator pursues the complaint in accordance with the procedures described in the Chapman University Academic Integrity Policy.</p>
            <p>If the Administrator determines that an allegation of misconduct against a student Respondent warrants a Preliminary Inquiry yet also determines that the alleged misconduct: (1) was supported by external funds; or (2) was published or presented for external audiences, then the Administrator refers the complaint to the Unit Dean who supervises the research in which the misconduct allegedly occurred. The Unit Dean serves as the Administrator from this point forward.</p>
            <h3>VI. THE PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</h3>
            <h4>A. Purpose</h4>
            <p>The Preliminary Inquiry ("Inquiry") is the first stage of the formal process for handling allegations of misconduct. The purpose of an Inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the evidence to determine whether a Formal Investigation is warranted. Therefore, an Inquiry does not require a full review of all the evidence related to the allegation.<strong>2</strong></p>
            <h4>B. Timeline</h4>
            <p>A Preliminary Inquiry is initiated when the Administrator appoints a Complaint Reviewer. The Preliminary Inquiry, including the submission of a written report, shall normally be completed within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the Complaint Reviewer is appointed. If the Administrator determines that circumstances warrant a longer period of time, the Administrator may grant an extension. In such a case, the record of the Inquiry shall include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the sixty day period.<strong>3</strong></p>
            <h4>C. Complaint Reviewer</h4>
            <p>The Inquiry is conducted by the "Complaint Reviewer," who may be the Administrator or may be an individual or individuals appointed by the Administrator to serve in this capacity. In determining who shall serve as Complaint Reviewer, the Administrator should consider the seriousness of the allegations, the need to complete the Inquiry in a timely fashion, the availability of personnel to conduct the Inquiry, and whether the nature of the complaint requires that the Complaint Reviewer have special expertise in order to assess the allegations. The Administrator should not appoint a Complaint Reviewer who has a potential conflict of interest or for a substantial reason might be unable to make an impartial evaluation of the subject of the Inquiry.</p>
            <p>If the Administrator does not serve as the Complaint Reviewer, the Administrator shall provide the Complaint Reviewer with a charge letter at the time of appointment. This letter will:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Set forth the time for completion of the Inquiry;</li>
             <li>Describe the allegations and any related issues identified during the allegation assessment;</li>
             <li>State that the purpose of the Inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the evidence, including the testimony of the Respondent, Complainant and key witnesses, to determine whether an Investigation is warranted, but not to determine whether misconduct definitely occurred or who was responsible;</li>
             <li>State that the Complaint Reviewer is responsible for preparing or directing the preparation of a written report of the Inquiry that meets the requirements of this Policy; and</li>
             <li>State that the Administrator will call for a Formal Investigation if it is determined: (1) that there is a reasonable basis for concluding that one or more allegation falls within the definition of misconduct, and (2) that the allegation may have substance, based on the Complaint Reviewer's review during the Inquiry.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>D. Notification</h4>
            <p>At the time of or before beginning the Inquiry, the Complaint Reviewer must make a Good Faith effort to notify the Respondent in writing that an allegation of misconduct has been made, if the Respondent is known. This notification shall include a brief but specific description of the complaint, the name(s) of the Complaint Reviewer(s), the purpose of the Inquiry, and a copy of this Policy. If the Inquiry subsequently identifies additional Respondents, they must also be notified in writing.<strong>4</strong></p>
            <p>Respondents should be given the opportunity to admit that misconduct occurred and that they committed the misconduct. Once such an admission has been made, the University may terminate its review of an allegation, provided the University's acceptance of the admission and any proposed settlement is approved by the appropriate funding agencies (if any).<strong>5</strong></p> The Complaint Reviewer shall immediately advise the Vice President of Research if any of the following conditions exist:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
             <li>There is an immediate need to suspend research activities;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate need to protect Federal funds or equipment;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate health hazard;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate need to protect the interests of the Complainant(s) or of the Respondent, as well as principal investigators, co-investigators, co-authors, and associates, if any;</li>
             <li>There is a likelihood that the alleged incident is going to be reported publicly;</li>
             <li>There is a reasonable indication of possible criminal violation as confirmed by the University's counsel. In that instance, the Vice President of Research must inform the funding agency within 24 hours of obtaining that information; or</li>
             <li>The health or safety of human or animal subjects is at risk or has been compromised, in which case the Vice President of Research shall promptly notify the Chair of the Chapman University Institutional Review Board (CUIRB) or Chair of the Chapman University Institutional Animal Care and User Committee.<strong>6</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Vice President of Research shall be responsible for notifying any affected funding agencies, as required, during the Preliminary Inquiry stage.</p>
            <h4>E. Conflict of Interest</h4>
            <p>If the Respondent believes that the Complaint Reviewer has a potential conflict of interest or for a substantial reason might be unable to make an impartial evaluation of the Respondent, the Respondent shall notify the Vice President of Research in writing of the specific basis for such a claim within three (3) calendar days of the Respondent's receipt of the Complaint Reviewer's notification. The Vice President of Research shall consider any information provided by the Respondent and any other information deemed relevant by the Vice President of Research, and shall notify the Respondent in&nbsp;writing of the outcome of the Respondent's challenge, which shall be within the Vice President of Research's sound discretion. &nbsp;</p>
            <h4>F. Securing Evidence</h4>
            <p>On the date on which the Respondent is notified, the Complaint Reviewer must take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the research records and evidence needed to conduct the Inquiry. The Complaint Reviewer shall inventory the records and evidence and sequester them in a secure manner. In the case that the research records or evidence encompass equipment or instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments. Where appropriate, the Respondent shall be given copies of, or reasonable, supervised access to the research records.<strong>7</strong></p>
            <p>During the Inquiry, the Respondent shall be expected to provide any evidence requested by the Complaint Reviewer as quickly as possible, and to respond to the complaint and provide other evidence on his or her own behalf within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving notice of the Inquiry.</p>
            <h4>G. Examination of Evidence</h4>
            <p>As a matter of good practice, the Complaint Reviewer should interview the Complainant and give him or her a transcript or recording of the interview for correction.<strong>8</strong> In addition, the Complaint Reviewer will normally interview the Respondent and key witnesses as well as examine relevant research records and materials. The Complaint Reviewer should be circumspect during the Inquiry, contacting only those individuals reasonably required and apprising them of the need for confidentiality. No inquiries outside of the University should be made at this juncture unless the Complaint Reviewer determines that such Inquiry is reasonably necessary. The scope of the Inquiry is not required to and does not normally include deciding whether misconduct definitely occurred, determining who committed the misconduct, or conducting exhaustive interviews and analyses. (However, if a legally sufficient admission of misconduct is made by the Respondent, misconduct may be determined at the Inquiry stage if all relevant issues are resolved.) All reasonable efforts shall be made by the Complaint Reviewer to preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the Inquiry.</p>
            <h4>H. Record Keeping</h4>
            <p>The Complaint Reviewer should keep detailed records of the Inquiry, including contacts with the Respondent, interviews, telephone conversations, and meetings. If the Complaint Reviewer determines to use media recordings for record-keeping purposes, such recordings shall only be made in compliance with applicable law, which generally requires the consent of the recorded parties. Records and data, or copies thereof, essential to the Inquiry must be kept in a secure location under the control of the Vice Provost of Faculty Affairs for seven (7) years. Specific security requirements, such as double-locking, vary by funding agency and will be observed as appropriate.<strong>9</strong></p>
            <h4>I. Assistance</h4>
            <p>The Administrator and the Vice President of Research should be available to the Complaint Reviewer throughout the Inquiry to review the charge, discuss the allegations (including any related issues), review the appropriate procedures for conducting the Inquiry, assist with organizing plans for the Inquiry, answer&nbsp;any questions raised by the Complaint Reviewer, and otherwise advise the Complaint Reviewer as needed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Complaint Reviewer may consult with experts within and without the University in order to conduct a fair and impartial Inquiry and a thorough and authoritative evaluation of the relevant evidence. In all such consultations, the Complaint Reviewer should maintain confidentiality as far as is possible.</p>
            <h4>J. Draft Inquiry Report</h4>
            <p>At the conclusion of the Inquiry, the Complaint Reviewer shall prepare a Draft Inquiry Report, which shall:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Identify the name and position of the Respondent;</li>
             <li>Provide the name(s) and position(s) of all persons who served as Complaint Reviewers;</li>
             <li>Describe the allegations of misconduct examined by the Complaint Reviewer;</li>
             <li>Summarize the process used and evidence reviewed (documentary and interviews);</li>
             <li>List any external funding agencies that supported the activities in which the misconduct was alleged to have occurred; and</li>
             <li>Provide a short and plain statement of the Complaint Reviewer's basis for recommending or not</li>
             <li>recommending that the allegations warrant a Formal Investigation.<strong>10</strong></li>
            </ul> The Complaint Reviewer should submit the Draft Inquiry Report to the University's counsel, who shall review the report for legal sufficiency. The Complaint Reviewer should then submit the Draft Inquiry Report, along with all secured documents and data, to the Administrator. 
            <br>
            <h4>K. Right to Review and Respond</h4>
            <p>The Administrator shall be responsible for providing a copy of the Draft Inquiry Report to the Respondent and informing the Respondent that he or she is entitled to comment on the report within ten (10) calendar days from the Respondent's receipt of the report.<strong>11 </strong></p>
            <p>The Administrator shall notify the Complainant whether the Inquiry determined that a Formal Investigation is warranted and may provide relevant portions of the Draft Inquiry Report to the Complainant for comment. The Complainant must enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to access the Inquiry report.</p>
            <h4>L. Final Inquiry Report</h4>
            <p>Any comments that are submitted by the Respondent or Complainant will be attached to the Final Inquiry Report. Based on the comments, the Complaint Reviewer may revise the Draft Inquiry Report as appropriate. The Complaint Reviewer shall then finalize the Inquiry report and submit it to the Administrator.</p>
            <p>The Final Inquiry Report, along with the Administrator's written determination and any other detailed documentation to support the determination must be maintained by the Vice Provost of Faculty Affairs in a secure manner for a period of at least seven (7) years after the termination of the Inquiry.<strong>12</strong></p>
            <h4>M. Outcomes of the Preliminary Inquiry</h4>
            <p>Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the Final Inquiry Report, the Administrator, in consultation with the Vice President of Research, shall determine whether the University will conduct a Formal Investigation ("Investigation"). An Investigation is warranted if the Administrator concludes that: (1) there is a reasonable basis for concluding that one or more allegations fall within the definition of misconduct under this Policy, and (2) the information gathered during the Inquiry indicates that the allegation of misconduct may have substance.</p>
            <p>If the Administrator determines that an Investigation is not warranted, the Administrator shall provide the Respondent, the Vice President of Research with a copy of the Final Inquiry Report, along with a letter explaining the Administrator's determination that an Investigation is not warranted. The Administrator shall also provide a copy of this letter to the Complainant and may provide the Complainant with relevant portions of the Final Inquiry Report, as the Administrator deems appropriate.</p>
            <p>If the Administrator determines that an Investigation is warranted, he or she shall notify the Respondent, in writing, of the initiation of an Investigation. This notification shall (1) specify the allegations of misconduct to be investigated, (2) inform the Respondent of his or her right to be represented by counsel or other advisor during the Investigation, and (3) refer the Respondent to this Policy. The Administrator shall also provide the Respondent with a copy of the Final Inquiry Report and any other detailed documentation to support the determination of the Administrator. If the alleged misconduct involves research supported by external funds, the Administrator shall refer the Respondent to Part 93 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR"). If the alleged misconduct involves research supported by the National Science Foundation, the Administrator shall refer the Respondent to Part 689 of Title 45 CFR.<strong>13</strong></p>
            <p>If the Administrator determines that an Investigation is warranted, the Administrator shall also notify the Vice President of Research by providing a copy of the advising letter, along with a copy of the Final Inquiry Report. The Vice President of Research shall be responsible for notifying external funding agencies, as required, and for providing these agencies with the following information, upon request: (1) a copy of this Policy; (2) the research records and evidence reviewed, transcripts or recordings or any interviews, and copies of all relevant documents; and (3) the charges to be considered in the Investigation.<strong>14</strong></p>
            <p>The Administrator shall also notify principal investigators, co-investigators, and co-authors, if any, whose research may be affected by the alleged misconduct. These individuals must enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to access the Inquiry report.</p>
            <p>If an Investigation has been deemed necessary, the Administrator shall also notify the Complainant and may provide the Complainant with relevant portions of the Final Inquiry Report, as the Administrator deems appropriate. The Complainant must enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to access the Inquiry report.</p>
            <h3>VII. THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION</h3>
            <h4>A. Purpose</h4>
            <p>The purpose of the Formal Investigation is to develop a factual record by exploring the allegations in detail and examining the evidence in depth, leading to recommended findings on whether misconduct has&nbsp;been committed, by whom and to what extent, and what disciplinary actions (if any) should be imposed. The Investigation will also determine whether there are additional instances of possible misconduct that would justify broadening the scope beyond the initial allegation.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>B. Timeline</h4>
            <p>The Administrator shall appoint an Investigation Committee ("Committee") within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the Administrator determines that an Investigation is warranted.<strong>15</strong> The Committee shall normally conclude its Investigation and submit a written report containing its findings and recommendations within one hundred twenty calendar days (120) of being appointed. If this deadline cannot be met, the Committee shall submit a request for an extension to the Administrator, along with an interim report on their progress to date and an estimated date for the completion of the report. If the Administrator approves this request, the Administrator shall provide a copy of the interim report, along with an explanation justifying the extension, to the Respondent, the Vice President of Research.<strong>16</strong> The Vice President of Research, of their designee, shall inform funding agencies of the extension, as required by these funding agencies.</p>
            <h4>C. Investigation Committee</h4>
            <p>The Investigation Committee is charged with conducting the Formal Investigation. The Committee shall include at least three members, all of whom shall hold the rank of Full Professor and at least one of whom shall be tenured. In appointing members of the Committee, the Administrator shall consider the relationship of the Respondent(s) to the University and whether the allegations relate to research that was supported by external funding. In all cases the Committee must consist of individuals who do not have a personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest that would prevent them from acting without bias. The Committee should include at least one individual from outside the Respondent's primary unit, and should include at least one individual with the appropriate expertise to conduct the Investigation, interview the Respondent and Complainant, and evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation.<strong>17</strong> The Administrator may not serve on the Committee.</p>
            <p>At the time of appointment, the Administrator shall provide a charge letter to the Committee. This letter shall:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Describe the allegations and any related issues identified during the Inquiry;</li>
             <li>Identify the Respondent;</li>
             <li>Inform the Committee that it must conduct the Investigation as prescribed by this Policy;</li>
             <li>Provide a definition of misconduct in research;</li>
             <li>Inform the Committee that it must evaluate the evidence and testimony to determine whether, based on a preponderance of the evidence, misconduct has occurred and, if so, the type and extent of it and who was responsible; and</li>
             <li>Inform the Committee that it must prepare or direct the preparation of a written report of the Investigation that meets the requirements of this Policy</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>D. Notification</h4>
            <p>The Administrator shall notify the Respondent, in writing, of the initiation of an Investigation and the identities of the individuals who have agreed to serve on the Committee. The Administrator shall also&nbsp;notify the Respondent, in writing, of any new allegations, not addressed in the Inquiry or in the initial notice of investigation, within a reasonable time after the determination to pursue those allegations.<strong>18</strong> &nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Administrator shall notify the Vice President of Research of Research Integrity of the initiation of any Investigation. In addition, the Administrator and/or the Committee shall notify the Vice President of Research immediately if any of the following conditions, which were not reported in the Preliminary Inquiry phase, are deemed likely to exist:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>There is an immediate need to suspend research activities;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate need to protect Federal funds or equipment;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate health hazard;</li>
             <li>There is an immediate need to protect the interests of the Complainant(s) or of the Respondent, as well as principal investigators, co-investigators, co-authors, and associates, if any;</li>
             <li>There is a likelihood that the alleged incident is going to be reported publicly;</li>
             <li>There is a reasonable indication of possible criminal violation as confirmed by the University's counsel. In that instance, the Vice President of Research or their designee must inform the funding agency within 24 hours of obtaining that information; or</li>
             <li>The health or safety of human or animal subjects is at risk or has been compromised, in which case the Vice President of Research or their designee shall promptly notify the Chair of the Chapman University Institutional Review Board (CUIRB) or Chair of the Chapman University Institutional Animal Care and User Committee.<strong>19</strong></li>
            </ul> The Vice President of Research or their designee shall be responsible for notifying any affected funding agencies, as required, during the Formal Investigation stage. 
            <h4>E. Conflict of Interest</h4>
            <p>If the Respondent believes that any proposed Committee member has a potential conflict of interest or for a substantial reason might be unable to make an impartial evaluation of the Respondent, the Respondent shall notify the Vice President of Research in writing of the specific basis for such a claim within three (3) calendar days of the Respondent's receipt of the Complaint Reviewer's notification. The Vice President of Research shall consider any information provided by the Respondent and any other information deemed relevant by the Vice President of Research, and shall notify the Respondent in writing of the outcome of the Respondent's challenge, which shall be within the Vice President of Research's sound discretion.</p>
            <h4>F. Securing Evidence</h4>
            <p>On the date on which the Respondent is notified of the initiation of an Investigation, the Administrator shall take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of and sequester in a secure manner all research records and evidence needed to conduct the Investigation that were not previously sequestered during the Inquiry. The need for additional sequestration of records for the Investigation may occur for any number of reasons, including the University's decision to investigate additional allegations not considered during the Inquiry stage or the identification of records during the Inquiry process that had not been previously secured. The procedures to be followed for sequestration during the Investigation are the same procedures that apply during the Inquiry.<strong>20</strong></p>
            <h4>G. Examination of Evidence</h4>
            <p>The Committee shall examine evidence including, but not limited to, the following: research data and proposals, publications, correspondence, and memoranda of meetings or telephone calls. The Committee must interview the Complainant, where possible, and provide him or her a copy of the transcript or recording of the interview for correction. The Committee must also interview the Respondent and provide him or her a copy of the transcript or recording of the interview for correction. The Committee should also interview individuals suggested by the Complainant and the Respondent, as well as other individuals determined by the Committee as likely to have pertinent information regarding material allegations. Transcripts or detailed summaries of these interviews should be provided to the interviewed party for correction and should be included in the investigator file.<strong>21</strong> If the Committee determines to use media recordings for record-keeping process, such recordings shall only be made in compliance with applicable law, which generally requires the consent of the recorded parties.</p>
            <p>The Committee shall exercise all diligence to examine all evidence relevant to reaching a decision on the merits of each allegation. The Committee should also diligently pursue all significant issues and leads discovered that are deemed relevant to the Investigation, including any evidence of additional instances of possible misconduct.<strong>22</strong></p>
            <h4>H. Record Keeping</h4>
            <p>The Committee should maintain a detailed investigative file, including a log of investigative activities, copies of correspondence related to the Investigation, transcripts or summaries of interviews, reference materials used in the course of the Investigation, and other documents gathered for purposes of the Investigation. Records and data, or copies thereof, essential to the Investigation must be kept in a secure location under the control of the Vice Provost of Faculty Affairs for seven (7) years. Specific security requirements, such as double-locking, vary by funding agency and will be observed as appropriate.<strong>23</strong></p>
            <h4>I. Assistance</h4>
            <p>The Administrator and the Vice President of Research or their designee should be available to the Committee throughout the Investigation to review the charge, discuss the allegations (including any related issues), review the appropriate procedures for conducting the Investigation, assist with organizing plans for the Investigation, answer any questions raised by the Committee, and otherwise advise the Committee.</p>
            <p>The Committee may consult with experts within and without the University in order to conduct a fair and impartial Investigation and a thorough and authoritative evaluation of the relevant evidence. In all such consultations, the Complaint Reviewer should maintain confidentiality as far as is possible.</p>
            <h4>J. Draft Investigation Report</h4>
            <p>Upon completing its Investigation, the Committee shall prepare a Draft Investigation Report. The Draft Investigation Report shall:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Identify the Respondent(s)</li>
             <li>Describe the nature of the allegation of misconduct;</li>
             <li>Describe and document the level of support from external funding agencies implicated in the allegation;</li>
             <li>Describe the specific allegations of misconduct considered in the Investigation;</li>
             <li>Include the institutional policies and procedures under which the Investigation was conducted;</li>
             <li>Identify and summarize the research records and evidence reviewed and identify any evidence taken into custody but not reviewed;</li>
             <li>Include transcripts or accurate summaries of interviews conducted during the course of the Investigation;</li>
             <li>Include a statement of findings for each allegation of misconduct identified during the Investigation. Each statement of findings must: (1) specify the nature of the misconduct and whether it was committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; (2) summarize the facts and the analysis that support the conclusion, utilizing the appropriate burden of proof and considering the merits of any reasonable explanation by the Respondent, including any effort by the Respondent to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she did not engage in misconduct because of honest error or a difference of opinion; (3) identify the support by external funding agencies, if any; (4) identify whether any publications need correction or retraction; (5) identify the person(s) responsible for the misconduct; and (6) list any current support or known applications or proposals for support that the Respondent has pending with external funding agencies; and</li>
             <li>Describe the Committee's recommendations for disciplinary action, if any, in accordance with applicable University policies.<strong>24</strong></li>
             <li>The Committee should submit the Draft Investigation Report to the University's counsel, who shall review the report for legal sufficiency. The Committee should then submit the Draft Investigation Report, along with all secured documents and data, to the Administrator.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>K. Right to Review and Respond</h4>
            <p>The Administrator shall be responsible for providing the Respondent with a copy of the Draft Investigation Report and, concurrently, a copy of, or supervised access to the evidence on which the Draft Investigation Report is based. The Respondent will be allowed thirty (30) calendar days from the date he or she received the Draft Investigation Report to submit comments to the Administrator. The Respondent's comments (if any) must be included and considered in the Final Investigation Report.<strong>25</strong></p>
            <p>The Administrator may also provide the Complainant a copy of the Draft Investigation Report, or relevant portions of the Draft Investigation Report and any supporting evidence, for comment. If the Draft Investigation Report is provided to the Complainant, the Complainant will be allowed thirty (30) calendar days from the date he or she received the Draft Investigation to submit comments to the Administrator. The Complainant's comments (if any) must be included in the Final Investigation Report. The Complainant must enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to access the Draft Investigation Report.<strong>26</strong></p>
            <h4>L. Final Investigation Report and Recommendations</h4>
            <p>The Administrator will assist the Committee in finalizing the Draft Investigation Report, including ensuring that the comments of the Respondent and Complainant (if any) are included and that the&nbsp;Committee's recommended actions are clearly stated. The Administrator shall add to the Investigation Report his or her written concurrence with the Committee's recommendations or his or her alternative recommendations, in case the Administrator does not agree with the recommendations of the Committee. The Administrator shall transmit the Final Investigation Report to the Respondent, the Vice President of Research, within seven (7) calendar days of receiving it from the Committee.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>M. Right to Review and Respond</h4>
            <p>The Respondent shall have seven (7) calendar days to provide a response to the actions recommended in the Final Investigation Report. This response shall be limited to the recommendation of discipline (as opposed to a challenge to the determination that misconduct occurred). The Administrator may also provide the Vice President of Research with recommendations regarding the other findings and conclusions of the Committee.</p>
            <h3>VIII. CONCLUSION</h3>
            <h4>A. The Final Decision</h4>
            <p>Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the last day for Respondent to submit a response to the Final Investigation Report, the Vice President of Research will determine in writing: (1) whether the University accepts the Final Investigation Report and its findings, and (2) what the University's actions in response to the findings shall be. In making the Final Decision, the Vice President of Research shall use Preponderance of the Evidence as the standard of proof. If the Final Decision rendered by the Vice President of Research varies from the findings and recommendations of the Committee, the Vice President of Research will, as part of this written determination, explain in detail the basis for rendering a decision different from that of the Committee. Alternatively, the Vice President of Research may return the report to the Committee with a request for further fact-finding or analysis.</p>
            <h4>B. Notification</h4>
            <p>When the Vice President of Research has reached a Final Decision on the case, the Vice President of Research will normally notify, in writing, the Respondent, the Administrator, the Principal Investigator(s) (if any), and the Complainant. The Vice President of Research will determine whether law enforcement agencies, professional societies, professional licensing boards, editors of journals, collaborators, or other relevant parties should be notified of the outcome of the case. The Vice President of Research is responsible for ensuring compliance with all notification requirements of funding or sponsoring agencies.<strong>27</strong></p>
            <h4>C. Right to Appeal</h4>
            <p>If the Respondent is a faculty member subject to Section X of the Chapman University Faculty Manual ("Section X"), he or she may file a grievance with respect to any disciplinary action imposed as a result of a finding of misconduct, in accordance with the procedures described in Section X. Such grievance shall be limited to the nature and level of disciplinary action imposed. The Faculty Grievance Board shall accept the factual findings and conclusions of the Investigation, and shall not accept evidence or consider argument relating to the underlying factual findings of the Investigation, such as whether misconduct occurred.</p>
            <p>Students, who do not otherwise have an academic, administrative, or staff title, may appeal under the policies and procedures outlined in the Chapman University Student Conduct Code or procedures of the Academic Integrity Committee depending on the findings.<br><br>Staff members may appeal under relevant policies in the Staff and Administrative Handbook. <br>In the event of any inconsistencies between this Policy and otherwise applicable provisions of the Faculty Manual, Student Conduct Code, Academic Integrity Committee or Staff and Administrative Handbook, the provisions of this Policy shall be applied.</p>
            <h4>D. Restoration of Reputation of the Respondent</h4>
            <p>If an Investigation is found to be not warranted, or the Respondent has been exonerated by an Investigation, all references to the allegation(s) shall be expunged from the Respondent's personnel file. In addition, the University will endeavor to restore the Respondent's reputation. This may be accomplished through communication with members of the research community who are aware of the allegation, publicizing the final outcome in forums in which the allegation of misconduct was previously publicized, or taking other steps worked out in coordination with the Respondent and the Vice President of Research.<strong>28</strong></p>
            <h4>E. Termination or Resignation of the Respondent</h4>
            <p>The termination of the Respondent's institutional affiliation, by resignation or otherwise, before or after an allegation of misconduct has been reported, will not preclude or terminate the misconduct proceeding or otherwise limit any of the University's responsibilities.</p>
            <p>If the Respondent, without admitting to the misconduct, elects to resign his or her position after the University receives an allegation of misconduct, the Initial Assessment will proceed, as well as the Inquiry and Investigation, as appropriate based on the outcome of the preceding steps. If the Respondent refuses to participate in the process after resignation, the Administrator, Complaint Reviewer, and Committee will use their best efforts to reach a conclusion regarding the allegation, noting in their reports the Respondent's failure to cooperate and its effect on the evidence.</p>
            <h4>F. Premature Closures</h4>
            <p>Generally, all Inquiries and Investigations will be carried through to completion and all significant issues will be pursued diligently. If the University plans to end proceedings at the Inquiry, Investigation, or appeal stages on the basis that the Respondent has admitted guilt, the University has reached a settlement with the Respondent, or for any other reason except for a finding of no misconduct, the Vice President of Research must notify the appropriate funding agencies in advance.<strong>29</strong></p>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Provides policy guidance related to the ownership, assignment and control of intellectual property in potentially patentable and patented inventions by members of the Chapman community.</p>
            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>This Policy governs the ownership and control of intellectual property rights in potentially patentable and patented inventions, including patentable software, at Chapman University (the “University”). A primary purpose of this Policy is to provide incentive for faculty and staff to apply their skills, knowledge and creative talent to research and to protect the University’s investment in that research.</p>
            <p>All faculty, staff, student employees, as well as non-employees who participate in teaching and/or research or scholarship projects at the University are bound by this policy and they are referred to in this policy as “Inventor(s).” They are also required to sign the Chapman University Patent and Copyright Agreement found on the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage.</p>
            <p>This policy applies, and those subject to this policy are deemed to assign their rights to inventions as required under this policy, whether or not a Chapman University Patent and Copyright Agreement is signed and is on file.</p>
            <p>This policy shall apply to all inventions conceived or first reduced to practice on or after January 28, 2013.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The University’s policy governing copyrightable works can be found on the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage.</p>
            <h3>GENERAL POLICY</h3>
            <ol>
             <li>All potentially patentable inventions conceived or first reduced to practice in whole or in part by Inventors in the course of their University responsibilities or with more than incidental use of University resources, shall be disclosed on a timely basis to the University. Title to all such inventions is hereby assigned, and the Inventor agrees to assign title to the University, regardless of the source of funding, if any. The Inventor(s) shall cooperate with the University, at the University’s expense, to document, perfect and record such assignment.</li>
             <li>The University requires Inventors to use University’s invention disclosure form for disclosure of inventions and the form is available at the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage. Invention disclosures must be timely and complete.</li>
             <li>The University shall share royalties from inventions assigned to the University with the Inventor(s) as described below in Section C4.</li>
             <li>The Inventors, acting collectively where there is more than one, may petition the University to place their inventions in the public domain if they believe that would be in&nbsp;the best interest of technology transfer and if doing so is not in violation of the terms of any agreements related in any way to the invention or its development or in violation of applicable law. The determination of whether to agree to such request, and any applicable additional terms, will be made by the University Intellectual Property Committee. &nbsp;</li>
             <li>The Inventor(s) may petition the University to assign ownership of the invention back to the Inventor(s), to the extent possible under the terms of any agreements that supported or related to the work and to the extent permitted by applicable law, under the following circumstances: 
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
               <li>No earlier than three (3) months after the date of the University’s receipt of the&nbsp;applicable invention disclosure, the Inventor(s) may so petition the University and the University may determine: &nbsp; 
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                 <li>it has no interest in pursuing the claimed invention, in which case it will&nbsp;assign the invention to the Inventor(s) to the extent possible under the terms of any agreements that supported or related to the work and to the extent permitted by applicable law; or &nbsp;</li>
                 <li>it continues to have an interest in pursuing the claimed invention, in which&nbsp;case it will not assign the invention to the Inventors and Section B5(ii) shall apply; or &nbsp;</li>
                 <li>it needs more time to make a determination of whether it has an interest in pursuing the claimed invention and will respond within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed six (6) months, subject to extension as mutually agreed.</li>
                </ol></li>
               <li>If the University determines under B5(i)(b) that it has an interest in pursuing the&nbsp;claimed invention, and the University fails to derive income from an invention for a period of ten (10) years after the date of the applicable invention disclosure, the Inventor(s) may re-petition the University. &nbsp;</li>
               <li>If at any time the University determines to abandon all pursuit of a claimed&nbsp;invention, the University will notify the Inventor(s) at the Inventor(s) last known address and the Inventor(s) may re-petition the University. At any time after the initial three (3) month period described in B5(i), but no more frequently than once in any twelve (12) month period, the Inventor(s) may request that the University&nbsp;confirm in writing that it has not abandoned all pursuit of the Inventor(s)’s claimed invention.&nbsp;</li>
              </ol></li>
            </ol>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The determination of whether to agree to such request, and any applicable additional terms, will be made by the University Intellectual Property Committee.</p>
            <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
             If the University does determine to assign the invention back to the Inventor(s), the University shall receive a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license to the invention for academic and internal purposes.&nbsp;
            </div>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Waivers of the provisions of this policy may be granted by the University Intellectual Property Committee on a case-by-case basis, giving consideration among other things to University obligations to sponsors, University obligations under applicable law, whether the waiver would be in the best interest of technology transfer, whether the waiver would be in the best interest of the University and whether the waiver would result in a conflict of interest.</p>
            <h3>ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES</h3>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Invention Disclosures</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             An invention disclosure is a document which provides information about the inventor(s) of an invention, a description of what was invented, circumstances leading to the invention, and facts concerning subsequent activities. It helps the University determine if an invention is patentable and provides the technical information needed to draft a patent application.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Inventors must prepare and submit an invention disclosure for each potentially patentable invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in whole or in part in the course of their University responsibilities or with more than incidental use of University resources (See C2 below). The invention disclosure must be submitted as soon as practicable after conception and must include a detailed description of any commercial interest the Inventor is aware of in such invention.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             A disclosure form found at the <a href="../../campus-services/legal-affairs/policy/index.aspx">Institutional Policies</a> webpage describing the invention and including other related facts should be prepared by the inventor and forwarded to the University Intellectual Property Committee via the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Use of University Resources</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Individuals may not use University resources, including facilities, personnel, equipment, or confidential information, except in an incidental way, for any non-University purposes, including outside consulting activities or other activities in pursuit of personal gain.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The occasional and infrequent use of the following would typically not constitute "more than incidental use of University resources": routinely available, office-type equipment, including desktop computers and commercially-available software and use of reference materials or other resources collected on the University campus. Use of the following would constitute "more than incidental use of University resources": the use of specialized, research facilities, equipment or supplies provided by the University for academic purposes, or the significant expenditure of an individual’s working hours at the University.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">3. University Duty and Mission</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Any ownership by the University of a patent or invention, or any determination by the University not to grant an Inventor’s petition to assign a patent or invention to the Inventor, shall not constitute any promise, duty or undertaking on the part of the University with respect to the protection, enforcement or exploitation of such patent or invention. The University’s research and teaching missions take precedence over patent and commercialization considerations. While the University recognizes the benefits of patent development, the direction of University research should not be unduly influenced by patent considerations or personal financial interests.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Office of Research and Sponsored Programs handles the review of contracts and grants related to University-owned inventions.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;4. Cash Royalties</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">All licensing and royalty payments from University patents are administered by the Office of Contract and Grant Accounting. The distribution of any such income between the Inventor(s) and the University is negotiable; however, the Inventor(s) will be awarded thirty percent (30%) of any such royalty income after the University is reimbursed for any direct costs such as, for example, costs associated with development, protection, marketing, licensing and enforcement of rights in the Patent Material. After such deductions and after disbursement of the amounts awarded to the Inventors(s), the net amount received by the University will be divided as follows:</p>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - twenty percent (20%) to the Chancellor’s Office;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - twenty percent (20%) to the faculty member’s Dean’s Office;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - twenty percent (20%) to the Chief Operating Officer’s Office;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - fifteen percent (15%) to the faculty member’s department or unit, if no department exists; and
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 90px;">
             - twenty-five percent (25%) to the faculty member’s laboratory or research center.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             The portion of net royalty distributed to the University, Department, laboratory or research center must be used for research or educational purposes only.
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Administration of Policy</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             This policy and disputes under this policy will be administered by the Intellectual Property Committee. Decisions of this panel shall be final and nongrievable under other internal processes.
            </div>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">EXPLANATION OF TERMS</h3>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">1. PATENT</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             A U.S. patent is a grant issued by the U.S. Government giving an inventor the right to exclude all others from making, using, or selling an invention within the United States, its territories and possessions for a period of time. There are three types of patents in the U.S. Utility patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. Design patents may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. Plant patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             To obtain a patent, an application is prepared and filed with the U.S. Patent Office. The application process is complex and typically involves the use of specialized counsel. In the case of a utility patent, for example, the Patent Office reviews the application to determine if the invention is new, useful, and nonobvious and, if appropriate, grants a patent. This process can take approximately three to five years. A utility patent has a term of 20 years. Other countries also grant similar patent rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">2. PATENTABILITY</h4>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Not all inventions are patentable. Questions relating to patentability are often complex and usually require review and advice of specialized counsel. To be patentable under a utility patent for example, an invention must not be obvious to a worker with ordinary skill in that particular field. It must also be novel, meaning it must not have been previously publicly known or used by others or patented or described in a printed publication.
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
             Inventions that are otherwise patentable may become unpatentable for a variety of reasons. For&nbsp;example, an invention becomes unpatentable in the United States unless a patent application is filed with the U.S. Patent Office within 12 months after disclosure of the subject invention in a publication or any other action which results in the details of the invention becoming generally&nbsp;available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </div>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMMITTEE</h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Intellectual Property Committee shall consist of the Chancellor or his or her designee, the Chief Operating Officer, or his or her designee, and a Faculty Senate Designee.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Approved</strong> by Faculty Senate on November 16, 2012</em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Approved</strong> by the Academic Committee of the Board of Trustees on November 26, 2012</em></p>

           <h3 class="header" role="button" tabindex="0"><span class="show"></span><span class="hide"></span> Off Duty and Supplemental Pay for Faculty on Sponsored Activities </h3>
           <div class="content editableContent">
            <h3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3> Faculty members are recognized as experts in their fields and at times provide these services to external institutions, companies or agencies. In some of these instances, faculty are eligible to receive additional pay over and above their University contract. This includes extra pay when the faculty are “off-duty” and rare instances of supplemental pay when an overload situation occurs. This policy is for sponsored activities (i.e., external funding from any source and/or internal grants). It is meant to clarify the periods allowable for extra pay and the conditions where supplemental pay is allowable. In general, faculty effort allocation supported by sponsored activity should be evaluated the following order depending on availability of time within each category:
            <br>
            <ol>
             <li>off duty periods (e.g., summer months)</li>
             <li>available protected research time with consideration of existing commitments</li>
             <li>course buyout/release</li>
             <li>work overload supplemental pay (only when all previously listed options have been exhausted and the criteria outlined in this policy has been met)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>REASON FOR THE POLICY</h3> As a recipient of federal awards, Chapman University is obligated to comply with cost accounting standards according to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Code of Federal Regulations, 2CFR 220 – Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (OMB Circular A-21). 
            <br>
            <h3>POLICY</h3><strong>Salary for Sponsored Activities During Off Duty Periods </strong>
            <br>
            <br>Faculty are able to earn salary as extra pay for periods they are off duty (i.e., summer, breaks). Nine (9) month faculty can receive 3/9th of their academic year salary and ten (10) month faculty can receive 2/10th of their academic year salary during off duty periods (see below for defined periods which include summer). This extra pay can come from a combination of sponsored activities and institutional funds and includes research, administrative work occurring specifically in summer months, and summer teaching in excess of the faculty member’s contracted teaching load, but the total cannot exceed the amounts noted above.
            <br>
            <br>Compensation for a full month of extra pay is calculated as 1/9th or 1/10th of the Institutional Base Salary (IBS) which is the compensation paid to a faculty member for the professional services they provide to the university within their contract.
            <br>
            <br> <strong>Off Duty Periods for Extra Pay (does not include holidays)</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
             <li>Summer Months (June, July, August) depending on 9 or 10 month contract.</li>
             <li>Thanksgiving week, excluding Thanksgiving Day (4 days).</li>
             <li>Holiday break (Monday after last day of classes until first day of interterm). Excludes&nbsp; &nbsp; Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day (varies 9-11 days).</li>
             <li>Spring Break (5 days).&nbsp;</li>
            </ul><strong>Conditions for Off Duty Extra Pay</strong>
            <br>
            <br>The following conditions must be met in order for faculty members to receive extra pay during off duty periods.
            <br>
            <ol>
             <li>Requests for off duty extra pay (e.g., summer) should typically be included in the original proposal budget to the external entity and be identified as being pay during off duty periods.&nbsp; Off duty extra pay that was not included in the sponsored approved proposal/award budget must meet awarding sponsor guidelines for allowability or receive approval directly from the awarding sponsor.</li>
             <li>Funds from external sources for extra pay must be paid to the University and paid to the faculty member through the payroll system which permits accurate effort reporting.</li>
             <li>Treatment of extra pay and related activities must be consistent with the University’s treatment with non-grant funds.</li>
             <li>The National Science Foundation generally limits support to 2/9th among all support from NSF grants. However, NSF does allow a 3rd month of salary support under normal rebudgeting authority if needed to accomplish the goals of the project.</li>
             <li>If a sponsor has a salary cap (e.g. NIH), then charges to the grant will be subjected to those limits.</li>
            </ol><strong>Conditions for Overload Supplemental Pay</strong>
            <br>
            <br>According to federal regulations (2 CFR Part 200), intra-University consulting is assumed to be undertaken as a University obligation requiring no compensation in addition to full-time base salary. Under rare circumstances, faculty may be eligible for supplemental pay when an overload situation occurs (i.e., exceeding 100% effort). To be qualified, the circumstances of the overload must be appropriately documented, be included and separately set out in the proposal, be set out in the award agreement, and approved by the Dean, Vice President for Research, and Provost. 
            <br>
            <br>Faculty may receive supplemental pay from an external sponsor on an overload basis for work during the period covered by the academic year contract if all of the following conditions are met: 
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
             <li>All times for Off Duty Extra Pay (see above) have been exhausted.</li>
             <li>Supplemental pay during the academic year is allowed only if “buyout” of teaching commitments is not an option. Note that the cost of “buyout” is currently calculated as (1/24 times institutional base salary plus fringe per credit of reduced teaching load). &nbsp;</li>
             <li>The additional work is substantially outside of, or a substantial increase to the faculty member’s regular duties and aligns with performance of sponsor obligations.</li>
             <li>The faculty member has obtained the written approval of their Dean.</li>
             <li>The budget and scope of work must have been approved by an authorized University official and approved with the original budget proposed to the funding agency.</li>
             <li>The budget and scope of work/budget justification must have clearly stated that overload supplemental pay was being requested, and must have been approved by the agency’s authorized official prior to performance of the additional work and prior to the request for supplemental pay.</li>
             <li>The employee would be eligible for the overload pay for the related activities whether or not it is being paid from grant funds.</li>
            </ol><strong>Requests for Payment</strong>
            <br>
            <br>Requests for payment for all extra or supplemental salary must be made using an Extra Pay Request Form.&nbsp; Requests for summer salary should be submitted no later than the 1st week of May.&nbsp; Requests for off duty or work overload extra pay during the academic year should be submitted by the 1st week of September.

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p>Outlines the eligibility requirements to be a Principal Investigator (PI) at Chapman University, and the process for requesting an exception to the requirements.</p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This Policy is intended to set forth the eligibility requirements of a Principal Investigator (PI) at Chapman University (CU). This Policy also describes the processes for requesting and approving exceptions to the PI eligibility requirements</p>
            <h3>Definition of Principal Investigator</h3>
            <p>A Principal Investigator is responsible for the intellectual direction, design, scientific or technical conduct, administrative conduct, and reporting of a research, training, or public service project. As such, the University recognizes one individual as the Principal Investigator and he/she must personally&nbsp;participate in the project to a significant degree and provide oversight on project activities. Proposals submitted for extramural funding or to the University regulatory oversight committees must name an eligible employee of the University to serve as Principal Investigator. In order to be designated as the PI on a proposal, sponsored project, or Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and&nbsp;Use Committee (IACUC), and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) protocol, an individual must be PI eligible.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The majority of funding agencies recognize only one Principal Investigator. In those instances where several names are listed in the proposal, the agency assumes that the first name listed is primus inter pares (first between equals).</p>
            <p>Other collaborating researchers who carry out portions of the project are considered to be Co-Principal Investigators (Co-PI) or Co-Investigators (Co-I). In order to serve as Co-PI or Co-I, an individual must be PI eligible. Although the PI may delegate fiscal or administrative aspects of the project to a Co-PI or Co-I, the PI still bears primary responsibility for the project.</p>
            <p>In the event of an apparent conflict between policies of the University and the funding agency, the more restrictive policy shall be followed.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Appointments Eligible for Principal Investigator Status</h3>
            <ul>
             <li>Faculty with Full-time (&gt;30 hours) status including, tenure track, tenured, research, and clinical.</li>
             <li>Administrators</li>
             <li>Librarians, Associate Librarians, Assistant Librarians</li>
             <li>Faculty with Emeritus status</li>
             <li>Provost and Presidential Fellows</li>
             <li>Academic Professionals in the Research Scientist series (Sr. Research Scientist, Research&nbsp;Scientist)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Appointments That Require Prior Approval for Principal Investigator Status</h3>
            <p>Anyone who wishes to serve as Principal Investigator, but does not meet the eligibility criteria set forth above, must receive approval from the Vice President for Research upon the recommendation of their Dean, Director or Vice President in order to serve in the Principal Investigator Role. The individual must have the necessary experience and independence to compete for his or her own sponsored program and/or to administer the project. They must have previous experience with similar types of research projects and the ability to comply with all the requirements of the award or project. These individuals include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Faculty with visiting appointments of less than the term of the grant if awarded</li>
             <li>Affiliated Scholars with non-employee status on courtesy appointments</li>
             <li>Faculty with full-time status who are identified as instructional faculty</li>
             <li>Appointees salaried at less than full time status including adjunct faculty or lecturers</li>
             <li>Postdoctoral scholars or trainees</li>
             <li>Research Associates</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Appointments That Are Non-Eligible for PI Status</h3>
            <ul>
             <li>Graduate Students. Faculty advisors or mentors will be designated as Principal Investigators for graduate student fellowships or traineeships awarded as grants to the university.</li>
             <li>Research Assistants</li>
             <li>Undergraduate Students</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Requesting an Exception</h3> To request an exception to the PI policy, a formal request must be made to the Vice President for Research via email to include the following: 
            <ol>
             <li>Current Curriculum Vitae</li>
             <li>A copy of their Appointment Term or Faculty Contract</li>
             <li>Summary Statement of the proposed project</li>
             <li>Recommendation of Dean, Director or Vice President. Recommenders should carefully consider whether the PI requesting exception has the ability and experience necessary to administer the project if the exception is approved. If department or college resources are needed, assurance must be given that the necessary space or other resources will be provided or made available for the entire length of the project.</li>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Chapman University Principal Investigator (PI) Incentive Pay Program has been developed to enhance sponsored research and scholarly activities. By providing the opportunity for Principal Investigators (as defined in Chapman University’s PI Eligibility Policy) to be eligible for annual incentive payments, the program provides incentives for PIs to secure externally-funded research grants and contracts. The program is in addition to the Institutional Base Salary for PIs. Participation in the program is voluntary and is not mandated upon either the PI or the university. </span></p>
            <p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Purpose</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">The purpose of the PI Incentive Pay Program is to recognize and reward recipients of external funds that enhance research, scholarship, service and creativity; promote best practices in teaching and learning; implement other program improvements that advance the mission of Chapman University. </span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">The incentive pay is intended as a one-time, annual supplement to the recipient’s regular base salary (Institutional Base Salary or IBS). The payment is not part of the IBS for any purpose. The incentive payment is subject to the applicable federal and state taxes and FICA withholdings, but not eligible for contributions under retirement plans. The incentive payment does not affect a recipient’s eligibility for merit or other salary increases. Incentive payment may also be taken as funds to the PIs indirect cost account for research purposes if all financial obligations have been covered for the project by the sponsor. </span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Participation in the Program</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Participation in the program is voluntary and is possible when eligible faculty charge at least 5% effort and related portion of his/her Institutional Base Salary and fringe benefits to an extramurally sponsored grant/contract budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The PI will draw salary and fringe from the grant/contract account proportionate to his/her effort devoted to the project, thereby creating funds for this incentive program as salary savings from a Chapman University operational budget.</span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Under exceptional circumstances and on a case</span><span class="s2">‐</span><span class="s1">by</span><span class="s2">‐</span><span class="s1">case basis, a PI may be eligible for the program if they successfully acquire significant external funding from sources that do not allow for inclusion of salary in the grant/contract budget. Such exceptional circumstances must be justified by the dean and department head and approved by the Vice President for Research and the Provost. In such cases, the annualized effort for the employee approved on the grant/contract submission will be used to calculate the recovered salary for the parameters of the incentive payment calculations.</span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Incentive payments are contingent upon the PI meeting the eligibility requirements and comply with the terms and conditions of the program. </span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Incentive payments may not be paid from federal or state grants/contracts. Incentive payments will be paid from institutional operational accounts. The source of funds in these accounts will normally be funds recovered from charging a portion of the PIs salary and fringe to grant/contract funds. The payment may not be made by offsetting salary and fringe from one grant/contract account to another grant/contract.</span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Under normal circumstances, a PIs effort charged to a grant/contract will be attributed to the research portion of the PIs workload. For pre-approved cases where the PI has already fulfilled the effort related to the research portion of his/her workload, incentive payments from recovered salary will occur only after the amount of funds necessary to acquire the services needed to fulfill the teaching, advising and other responsibilities of the PI carrying out the grant/contract funded research has been determined and set aside for such purposes.</span></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Disclosure of Significant Financial Interests.</strong>
              <ol>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Investigators and Directors are required to disclose all "Significant Financial Interests" (as defined below) of the Investigator/Director and/or the Investigator/Director's spouse (registered domestic partner) and dependent children. The University's Conflicts Officer (CO) or Financial Conflicts of Interest Committee will review disclosures of Significant Financial Interest and determine whether any constitute a "Financial Conflict of Interest" (FCOI). An FCOI is a Significant Financial Interest that could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, negotiation, contracting or reporting of an externally sponsored activity.</li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Given the complexity of financial and non-financial relationships, Significant Interest disclosures will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the disclosure constitutes an FCOI, and if so, to determine an appropriate action.</li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Significant Financial Interests may not require FCOI Committee review, and may be handled administratively, if the conflict does not directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, negotiating, contracting or reporting of an externally sponsored activity, does not invoice students or human research subjects, or does not involve payment for personal services in excess of $5,000 in a 12-month period. However, the Vice President of Research, or his/her designee, reserves the right to require FCOI Committee review.</li>
              </ol></li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Significant Financial Interest</strong>. 
              <ol>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Definition</strong>. A "Significant Financial" Interest means one or more of the following interests, if it reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator/Director's institutional responsibilities, including research, teaching or service to the University. 
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">With regard to any publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure <em>and</em> the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date of the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. Remuneration includes any salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid authorship); equity interest includes any stock, stock option, or other ownership interest, as determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, <em>or</em> when the Investigator/Director (or Investigator/Director's spouse or dependent children) owns <em>any</em> equity interest, regardless of dollar value.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">With regard to intellectual property rights and interests (e.g., patents and copyrights), upon receipt of income related to such rights and interest. This does no include any royalty income received by the Investigator/Director from Chapman University for intellectual property rights assigned to Chapman by the Investigator/Director pursuant to Chapman's Inventions and Patent policy.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Any occurrence of reimbursed or sponsored travel related to your institutional responsibilities must also be disclosed, including instruction, research or service to Chapman University, with the exception of any travel reimbursed or sponsored by a federal, state or local government agency, an institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research center affiliated with an institution or higher education. Travel that is reimbursed by Chapman University from an sponsored fund account whose sponsor is an entity that is not one of those exempt entities shall be treated as a Significant Financial Interest. The Investigator/Director must disclosure the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor and/or organizer, the destination and its duration within 30 days of travel. Additional information, including the estimated cost of travel, may be requested by the CO and must be furnished upon request.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Payment for services</strong>. Any and all salaries and other payments for services (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, study design, management position, independent contractor, service on advisory committees or review panels of for-profit entities, board membership of for-profit entities, seminars, lectures or teaching engagements for for-profit entities), when totaled together exceed $5,000 during the previous twelve months or are expected to exceed $5,000 over the next twelve months.</li>
                </ol></li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Exclusions</strong>. The term "Significant Financial Interest" does <strong>not</strong> include: a) salary, royalties, or other remuneration from Chapman University; b) income from investment vehicles such as mutual funds or retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator/Director does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles; c) income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by government agencies, institutions of higher education, academic teaching hospitals, medical centers, or research institutes affiliated with institutions of higher education; d) income from service on advisory committees or review panels for government agencies, institutions of higher education, academic teaching hospitals, medical centers, or research institutes affiliated with institutions of higher education.</li>
              </ol></li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Timing of Required Disclosures</strong>
              <ol>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Investigator/Directors must provide all required financial disclosures through the submission of a completed FCOI Disclosure Form: 
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">On an annul basis, as specified by the Office of Research;</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">At any point when the investigator and/or research personnel establish a new outside relationship or change an existing relationship that creates a potential conflict under this policy.</li>
                </ol></li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;">In addition, Investigator/Directors must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">update</span> those financial disclosures: 
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">At the time of sponsored activity proposal submission;</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">Within thirty (30) days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through purchase, marriage or inheritance) any new Significant Financial Interest;</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">when engaging in activities requiring disclosure.</li>
                </ol></li>
              </ol></li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Review of Financial Disclosures</strong>.The following process shall apply to financial disclosures submitted by Investigator/Directors. 
              <ol>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Determination of Financial Conflicts of Interest</strong>. The CO or FCOI Committee will review each disclosed Significant Financial Interest to determine whether it could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, negotiating, contracting or reporting of an externally sponsored activity. If an FCOI exists, then the FCOI Committee, or the CO in consultation with the FCOI Committee, will determine what conditions or restrictions, if any should be imposed by the University to manage, reduce, or eliminate such conflict of interest.</li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Management of Financial Conflicts of Interest</strong>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">If the CO or FCOI Committee determines that the Significant Financial Interest constitutes an FCOI, then the FCOI Committee will review the research, the financial interests in question, and the areas of conflict, and recommend a strategy to the CO for the management of the Financial Conflict of Interest with a combination of elements it deems most conducive to the continued objective pursuit of research.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The CO will consult with the Investigator/Director on the strategy recommended by the FCOI Committee and will present a management plan to the Investigator/Director implementing the strategy.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The management plan may include conditions or restrictions to manage, reduce, or eliminate Financial Conflicts or Interest, including but are not limited to: (i) monitoring of research by independent reviewers; (ii) modification of the research plan; (iii) disqualification from participation in the portion of the externally sponsored activity that would be affected by Significant Financial Interests; (iv) divesture of Significant Financial Interests; (v) severance of relationships that create conflicts ; or (vi) public disclosure of Financial Conflicts of Interest</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The Investigator/Director must agree to the management plan before the research can proceed. If the CO and the Investigator/Director cannot agree upon a management plan, then the relevant regulatory bodies and funding agencies will be notified.</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The management plan is subject to final approval by the Vice President for Research. All management plans require monitoring by the CO, beginning six (6) months after the fully approved management plan is completed, and on a recurring schedule every six (6) months until such time as it is determined by the FCOI Committee, or the CO in consultation with the FCOI Committee, that the identified FCOI no longer exists.</li>
                </ol></li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Reporting of Financial Conflicts of Interest.</strong>

                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sponsoring agency</em>. Significant Financial Interest that are determined by the CO/FCOI Committee to be Financial Conflicts of Interest</li>
                 <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Public request</em>. As required by PHS regulations, information on the nature of such Conflicts of Interest will be made available to members of the public by the CO in response to inquiries specifying the investigator name and the research project in question within 5 business days of receipt of such requests.</li>
                </ol></li>
              </ol></li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Enforcement</strong><strong>. </strong>The University will use appropriate mechanisms for enforcement of this policy, which shall provide for sanctions where appropriate. Disciplinary proceedings initiated in connection with this policy shall be conducted in accordance with the Chapman University Faculty Handbook, the Chapman University Staff Handbook or the Student Code of Conduct, as appropriate. All relevant regulatory bodies and funding agencies will be promptly informed of disciplinary.</li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Records</strong>. The University will maintain records of all financial interest disclosures and of all actions taken to resolve Financial Conflicts of Interest for at least three (3) years beyond the termination or completion of the grant or contract to which they relate, or until the resolution of any governmental action or litigation involving those records, whichever is longer.</li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Training</strong>. 
              <ol>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Investigators on NIH/PHS-funded projects</em>. Each Investigator (including senior/key personnel) on projects funded by or proposed to NIH or other Public Health Service (PHS) affiliated agencies must complete training on the Investigator's responsibilities regarding conflicts of interest and disclosure of Significant Financial Interests via CITI<em>.</em></li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em></em><em>New or previously unfunded Investigators</em>. New and/or previously unfunded Investigators who notify the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects Administration of their intent to submit a research proposal to NIH or another PHS-affiliated agency will be required to complete training (and make the disclosures described above) prior to submission of their proposal.</li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Investigators/Directors on non-NIH/PHS projects, or research programs</em>. For Investigators/Directors sponsored by or seeking funding from NSF and/or other federal agencies, as well as any Investigators/Directors initiating research sponsored by a private, for-profit entity, the activities are optional but strongly recommended.</li>
               <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Repeat training</em>. Renewal training of active NIH/PHS-funded Investigators will be repeated every four years, and (i) on any occasion when Chapman University the training requirements, and (ii) when the University determines that the Investigator is found to be noncompliant with this policy or any management plan related to an identified FCOI.</li>
              </ol></li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>University’s Disclosure Statement.</strong> The University’s Disclosure Statement must be completed by all senior personnel who are submitting proposals to a federal sponsor. The certification page of a proposal cannot be signed until forms for all Investigator/Directors are submitted to the CO. By signing this form the applicant certifies that he/she has read this and a) does not have potential Financial Conflicts of Interest (“<em>I certify that I have read the Financial Disclosure policy which is effective for all federal proposals submitted through the University. I certify to the best of my knowledge that neither I nor my spouse, or dependents hold any significant financial interest that would reasonably appear to be related to my research, teaching and service responsibilities to Chapman University</em>”) or b) does have potential conflicts (“<em>I have the following relationships, affiliations, activities, or interests (financial or otherwise) which constitute potential conflicts under the Chapman University Conflict of Interest Policy</em>”). In either case, the applicant also declares that he/she will notify the CO of any change or discovery requiring modification of the above statement.</li>
             <li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Subrecipients</strong>. The University is responsible for ensuring all subrecipients’ compliance with the applicable federal regulations regarding Financial Conflicts of Interest. To this end, the University shall enter a written agreement with each subrecipient that shall specify whether this policy, or the applicable policy of the subrecipient’s institution, will apply to subrecipient Investigators. Said agreement will specify the timing for reporting of FCOIs by subrecipients to Chapman University to enable the timely review and reporting of such FCOIs in compliance with funding agency requirements.</li>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <h3>Authorship Principles</h3>
            <p>An important component in upholding the integrity of the research and scholarly enterprise is the assignment of authorship. It serves as an explicit way of assigning responsibility and giving credit for intellectual work. Authorship should be given to those who contribute and participate in substantive ways to scholarly and scientific work, and should honestly and accurately reflect actual contributions. Fair and equitable determination of authorship is important to the reputation, academic promotion, and funding support of the individuals involved, and to the strength and reputation of the authors’ respective institutions.</p>
            <p>As early as possible in the research or scholarly process, collaborators should discuss the general requirements for authorship of any manuscript that will report results of joint work. This does not mean deciding who will – or will not – be an author. Rather, the principles guiding authorship decisions should be discussed, potentially with reference to this or similar guidance documents. To prevent misunderstandings, it is recommended that discussions of authorship standards be held openly and frequently within collaborative projects. Agreements should be established between coauthors early in the writing process for each manuscript, and these agreements should be reviewed and revised as needed to reflect changes in the actual contributions of each individual.</p>
            <p>Disagreements sometimes arise regarding who should be named as an author of or contributor to intellectual work and the order in which individuals should be listed. Some of these disputes are a result of failed communication and expectation setting. This guidance is meant to serve as a set of standards that are shared by the academic community as a whole, to help facilitate open communication through adherence to common principles. These principles apply to all intellectual products, whether published or prepared for internal use or for broad dissemination.</p>
            <h3>Applicability</h3>
            <p>This guidance applies to all faculty, students, postdoctoral researchers, and staff.</p>
            <p>Designing an ethical and transparent approach to authorship and publication of research is the responsibility of the principal investigator(s). This guidance document outlines the ethical responsibilities of the investigator(s) and the University resources available to support implementation of the principles outlined herein.</p>
            <p>Chapman University acknowledges and appreciates that there are many different standards across fields regarding authorship (e.g., the order in which authors are listed). As a result, each laboratory, department, college and/or school should have conversations and clear guidelines around discipline-specific standards of authorship and, if needed, should supplement these guidelines with a description of their own customary ways of deciding who should be an author and the order in which authors will be listed. If such standards are documented in writing, they should be made available to all collaborators and discussed at the beginning of the collaboration.</p>
            <h3>Recommendations for Attribution of Authorship</h3>
            <p>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for its content. All co-authors should have been directly involved in all four of the following:</p>
            <ol>
             <li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; <strong>and</strong></li>
             <li>Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; <strong>and</strong></li>
             <li>Final approval of the version to be published; <strong>and</strong></li>
             <li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Some diversity exists across academic disciplines regarding norms for substantive contributions that would lead to attribution of authorship. This guidance is intended to allow for such variation in disciplinary best practices while ensuring authorship is not inappropriately assigned.</p>
            <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
            <p>Individuals who do not meet the requirements for authorship but who have provided a valuable contribution to the work should be acknowledged for their contributing role as appropriate to the publication</p>
            <h3>Recommendations for Implementation</h3>
            <p>Successful implementation of this guidance relies on a commitment to collegiality and open, frank, consistent communication and expectation-setting throughout the research and scholarly process. Integral to implementation of this guidance is the following:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Research groups should discuss authorship credit/criteria, presentation of joint work, and future directions of the research as early as practical, and frequently, during the course of their work. This should involve explicit discussion of expectations of continued collaboration if a contributor who would normally be considered an author leaves the project or institution during the conduct of the work. The lead investigator should initiate these discussions; however, any collaborator may raise questions or seek clarity throughout the course of the collaboration. Each lab or group may consider having a written guiding document in place.</li>
             <li>Collaborators are expected to adhere to good laboratory practices, including maintaining a complete laboratory notebook and annotating electronic files, as these practices will aide in identifying and clarifying individuals’ contributions to a project.</li>
             <li>Disposition of collaborative data and research materials should be mutually agreed upon among collaborators as early as practical and in accordance with any data-sharing and retention requirements;</li>
             <li>Laboratories, departments, and educational programs supporting scholarly work at Chapman should include in any procedure manuals this guidance and a description of their own customary ways of deciding who should be an author and the order in which authors are listed. This guidance and customary practices should be included in orientation of new members.</li>
             <li>Discussion of the principles of authorship outlined in this guidance should be integrated into any responsible conduct of research courses taught at Chapman.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Authorship Disputes and Resolution</h3>
            <p>Conflicts related to authorship may arise at any time during the research or scholarly process, resulting from differing perceptions of one’s contributions and resulting attribution of credit. Chapman University recommends adherence to the following procedures when a dispute arises, unless disagreements are a result of alleged fabrication or falsification of data or plagiarism and, therefore, instead subject to the institution’s <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/research/policies-and-guidance/index.aspx">Integrity in Research Policy</a>.</p>
            <ol>
             <li>Resolution of disputes among collaborators through open and collegial discourse and mutual agreement is strongly encouraged. To facilitate this process, any prior decisions or discussions among authors, including verbal or written agreements between coauthors, should be reviewed and considered. This guidance and any documented customary practices in the relevant discipline should be applied, as appropriate. Extending an invitation to a mutually agreed upon party outside the group who is familiar with publication norms in the field to informally serve as a neutral facilitator may ensure that all viewpoints are weighed and considered and objectively applied. It is expected that most disputes will be resolved collegially among collaborators.</li>
             <li>If the disagreement cannot be resolved among collaborators, input should be sought from a neutral third party, such as the University Ombudsperson or other trusted parties. 
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
               <li><strong>Department-level resolution</strong>. The collaborators should engage the Department Chair or his/her designee to facilitate a resolution of the dispute acceptable to all parties. This assumes that the Department Chair is not a direct party to the dispute and does not otherwise have a conflict of interest. If multiple departments are involved in the dispute or the Department Chair has a conflict, the parties may opt to engage the University Ombudsperson.</li>
               <li><strong>Engagement of the University Ombudsperson</strong>. Chapman’s ombudsperson is a resource available to all members of Chapman University and can act as a neutral party to mediate disputes at any point in the process. The ombudsperson is skilled at facilitating conflict resolution and while he/she cannot adjudicate an authorship dispute by taking formal action, he/she may bring together the parties involved to assist them in reaching their own settlement.</li>
               <li><strong>Graduate Research Resolution.</strong> In the event that a dispute arises regarding graduate student research, the disagreeing party/parties (student(s) and/or faculty member(s)) should request a meeting of all interested persons, with at least five business days' notice, for the purpose of resolving the problem. In the case of disputes between students, the meeting must include at least one faculty member familiar with the research. If the dispute cannot be resolved through this process, or if the proposed solution is unacceptable to the student(s) or the faculty member(s), the disagreeing party/parties may request that the dean of the college or school review the problem and recommend a solution. The dean may appoint a designee to review/recommend, provided the dean’s designee is not personally involved in the dispute. If the problem cannot be resolved at the department or college/school level, or if the dispute involves the dean of the college/school, the dispute should be appealed to the Vice Provost for Graduate Education, which will be the final level of appeal.</li>
               <li><strong>Resolution when authors are from multiple institutions:</strong> The collaborators should engage a mutually agreed upon neutral party outside the group who is familiar with publication norms in the field to facilitate a resolution.</li>
              </ol></li>

           <div class="content editableContent">
            <h3>Need for Guidance</h3>
            <p>A Core Lab is a facility whose activity supports research at Chapman and is measured based upon a specific quantitative basis. The costs associated with these activities are accounted for separately and charged to the users in proportion to the services rendered. The primary purpose is to provide specific research services to the University community or external users. External lab rates are to be requested for fixed rate laboratory testing only and are not to be established for general core lab facilities use charges.”</p>
            <p>Guidance is being established to ensure compliance with federal regulations and Cost Accounting Standards. This includes federal regulatory costing principals established by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl">2 CFR 200</a>, as well as the Chapman Fiscal Policy.</p>
            <h3>Establishment and Review of External Rates</h3>
            <p>Proposed external lab rates must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Research and Financial Services. This is required in advance of use of the external rates and on an annual basis as the activity of the Core Lab continues. Such approval memorandums should be submitted to the Office of Research prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year. It should be understood the fixed lab rates may require revision to avoid accumulating either a surplus or a deficit in the core lab account. The external rate should be based on the University’s fiscal year, unless another time period can be justified and the Office of Research has provided approval to deviate.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><em>External User</em></strong></p>
            <p>An external user is an entity or person with whom the University has no direct affiliation and for which the University has no fiduciary responsibility. The person or entity is external to the University’s mission, but wishes to engage the services of the center because of its unique equipment and/or its faculty/staff expertise.</p>
            <p>Rates charged to non-federal external users are not governed by federal cost recovery restrictions. A lab may charge a non-federal external user a premium rate. In fact, the operation should charge non-federal external users a market rate to prevent potential claims of unfair competition. Rates charged to external users who identify themselves as federally funded and provide documentation should be set to recover direct costs plus institutional overhead. Appropriate documentation includes a copy of the federal award approval or similar documentation.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Allowable Direct Costs</em></strong></p>
            <p>All allowable direct costs of a core lab that will be used in establishing user rates should be expended through one individual fund. Allowable costs include:</p>
            <ol>
             <li>Salaries and Wages</li>
             <li>Fringe Benefits</li>
             <li>Supplies and Materials (consumables)</li>
             <li>Depreciation expense on capital equipment</li>
             <li>Purchase costs for non-capital equipment</li>
             <li>Equipment Service Contracts</li>
             <li>Repairs and Maintenance</li>
             <li>Communication Fees, Mailings, Other Support Costs</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Salaries and wages include faculty and staff who provide services, direct the operation, supervise the staff and provide other administration and support functions. Effort Reports, where required, should agree with salary (including fringe) expenditures charged to a lab account.</p>
            <p>Supplies and materials include the supplies that are necessary for the operation of the lab. Office supplies are generally considered indirect costs and treated as unallowable. However, to the extent office supplies/materials are consumed solely for the operation of the lab in deliverance of its services, they may be included as allowable costs of the lab.</p>
            <p>If capital equipment is involved in producing the service, depreciation associated with that equipment may be included in the rates. Depreciation must be calculated based on the information in the University’s asset system, including purchase date, purchase cost, any federal contribution (which must be subtracted from the purchase costs) and useful life. The straight-line depreciation method should be used. The full purchase cost or the replacement cost of an asset cannot be the basis for the depreciation cost.</p>
            <p>Actual expenses for items such as travel, equipment service contracts, equipment maintenance, or long distance telephone charges incurred specifically for the operation of the lab should be treated as a direct cost of the lab and included in the rate calculation.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Request for Core Lab Rates</em></strong></p>
            <p>The following should be following to establish core lab rates:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>A complete proposal should be developed to justify the need for core lab rates and appropriately justify the rates based on the allowable direct costs noted above</li>
             <li>Proposals should be submitted to the Vice President for Research</li>
             <li>Proposals will be reviewed by the Office of Research and Financial Services</li>
             <li>Once approved, rates must be utilized on a consistent basis as outlined in this Guidance document</li>
             <li>Review of rates should be provided to the Office of Research after the Fiscal Year has closed. Revised rates should be submitted by August 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>It is essential that the lab’s costs and usage base be adequately documented to support the billings. Accordingly, each lab must observe the following practices:</p>
            <ol>
             <li>Collect and retain supporting documentation related to actual and accrued costs incurred by the lab. Historical cost data is stored in the University’s finance and procurement systems. Cost projection data must be maintained by the lab.</li>
             <li>Maintain adequate records to support the number of hours or other measure of services and/or materials which form the basis for customer billings. Usage data compiled by the lab usage systems provides adequate documentation.</li>
             <li>Retain working papers demonstrating rate development.</li>
             <li>Prepare external invoicing documents on at least a monthly basis.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Receipt of any external payments, not submitted directly to the Financial Services, must be directed to Office of Research upon receipt.</p>
            <h3>Business Process</h3>
            <p>The following process should be used to ensure proper charging and tracking of expenses to lab and sponsored project accounts:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Charge to Lab Account:</strong> Any expenses associated with the core lab tests should be charged to the lab account.</li>
             <li><strong>Cost Transfer to Grant Account:</strong> Based on&nbsp;lab&nbsp;tracking and confirmation from project PI,&nbsp;lab&nbsp;to complete a Sponsored Activity <a href="../_files/cost-transfer-request-form_01-07-20.xlsx">Cost Transfer Request Form (CTRF)</a> detailing the project, type and number of tests/procedures completed (per approved fixed&nbsp;lab&nbsp;rate) that transfers the cost from Lab Account to an external account 
              <ul>
               <li>Use expense account code&nbsp;<strong>Reclass – Fixed&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;Rate</strong></li>
               <li>Lab&nbsp;to submit completed CTRF to appropriate SPS Contracts &amp; Grants Administrator for review and approval</li>
               <li>If approved, SPS will provide the signed document to Financial Services to facilitate the cost transfer that will move the appropriate expense amount from the&nbsp;Core&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;Account to the appropriate sponsored project</li>
               <li>This action increases the balance in the&nbsp;Core&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;budget by removing the expense and decreases the balance in the sponsored project budget by adding the expense</li>
               <li>Once the cost transfer process has been completed, the expense(s) will be reflected on the sponsored project GL</li>
              </ul></li>
             <li><strong>Invoice to Sponsor:</strong> On a monthly basis, unless outlined otherwise in sponsor agreement/award, Financial Services will generate an invoice based off of the expenses reflected on the project GL 
              <ul>
               <li>Sponsored project invoices are provided to SPS for review and approval</li>
               <li>If approved, invoices are submitted to sponsor for payment</li>
              </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All Core Lab accounts are zero balanced at the end of the Fiscal Year, so Units are encouraged to management expenses appropriately throughout the year.</p>

           <h3 class="header" role="button" tabindex="0"><span class="show"></span><span class="hide"></span> Payments to Research Participants (Human Subjects) - Procedures </h3>
           <div class="content editableContent">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>It is not uncommon for human research participants to be paid for their participation in research. Payment for participation in studies is not considered a benefit, it is compensation for time, effort and for study-related expenses. It could also be considered a recruitment incentive.</p>
            <p>The amount and schedule of all participant payments must be submitted to the&nbsp;Chapman Institutional Review Board&nbsp;(IRB) at the time of initial review. The IRB reviews both the amount of payment and the proposed method and timing of disbursement to assure that they are neither coercive nor present undue influence [<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45 CFR 46.116</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=50.20">21 CFR 50.20</a>]. Compensation can be in the form of money, gift certificates, products, or other incentives. In some cases, payments are made to the parents or legal guardians of the participants.</p>
            <p>Researchers must not deviate from the amount, type, or timing of compensation without amending their protocol and securing IRB approval.</p>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <p><strong>Researchers/departments must</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
             <li>Describe Research Participant compensation in their IRB protocol (Subject Compensation section). If it is anticipated that a participant’s payment, as described in the IRB protocol, is going to exceed $599.99 per calendar year, the researcher shall have the participant complete the&nbsp;<a href="../_files/participant-payment.form.3.6.20.docx">Acknowledgement of Research Participant Compensation form</a>&nbsp;to ensure that participants are notified of the IRS reporting requirement and to explain that anonymity cannot be maintained. (See Section D.). Single payments that exceed $400 will also require the researcher shall have the participant complete the&nbsp;<a href="../_files/participant-payment.form.3.6.20.docx">Acknowledgement of Research Participant Compensation form&nbsp;</a></li>
             <li>Record in a log or other research document (such as the&nbsp;<a href="../_files/research-participant-compensation.log.xlsx">Research Participant Compensation Log</a>) participant payments by Cash or Gift Card, and include: 
              <ul>
               <li>Protocol name or number</li>
               <li>Human Subject Identifier alpha/numeric code assigned by researchers to protect the identity of participants) or identifier for Chapman employee or student.</li>
               <li>Date of the transaction</li>
               <li>Amount of payment</li>
               <li>Name of the person making the payment.</li>
              </ul></li>
             <li>Physically safeguard Cash or Gift Cards from loss at all times: 
              <ul>
               <li>Place them in a safe or a locked receptacle, and keep the receptacle in a properly secured area.</li>
               <li>They should be reconciled regularly (not less frequently than quarterly and upon termination of any award) by research personnel employed by the University or fiscal officer.</li>
               <li>In the event of a theft, the loss must be reported to the&nbsp;Chapman Public Safety office.</li>
              </ul></li>
             <li>Account for undistributed Gift Cards, cash, or non-monetary items 
              <ul>
               <li>There may be instances when the number of participants in the study are somewhat unknown, and more Gift Cards, cash, or non-monetary items are obtained than might ultimately be used.&nbsp; Since all items have cash value, the University and the researcher/designee must ensure these items are handled and tracked appropriately.&nbsp; The researcher/designee will be responsible for accounting for any remaining undistributed Gift Cards, cash, or non-monetary items purchased with University funds at the completion of the study, or six months into the study if the study is to exceed six months.</li>
               <li>If a researcher/designee has unused cash, the researcher/designee must return any unused cash to the Accounts Payable Office within 30 days after the completion of the study, or six months into the study if the study is to exceed six months.</li>
               <li>If a researcher/designee received a cash advance and has unused Gift Cards, cash, or non-monetary items, the researcher/designee must make a cash deposit to the Cashier’s Office equal to the dollar value of the remaining/unused Gift Cards, cash, or non-monetary items.&nbsp; The researcher/designee must make the deposit within 30 days after the completion of the study, or at six-month intervals if the study is to exceed six months.</li>
              </ul></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Procedures</h3>
            <p>Procedure to access funds will depend on the preferred&nbsp;Participant Payment Type&nbsp;and whether the participant is&nbsp;anonymous or not:</p>

            <h3>IRS Reporting and Collection of Social Security Numbers</h3>
            <ol>
             <li>It is the responsibility of the researcher to maintain accurate payment records according to University accounting standards and sponsor requirements. In addition, all Human Subject payments and gifts are considered income to the recipient and the IRS requires that Chapman University (or whoever is paying the research subjects for participation) report payments in excess of $599.99 per calendar year for tax purposes.&nbsp; If a researcher anticipates reaching this threshold with a single subject(s) in a calendar year, the researcher shall have the participant complete the Acknowledgement of Patient Compensation form (HYPERLINK) to ensure that participants are notified of the IRS reporting requirement and to explain that anonymity cannot be maintained. Single payments that exceed $400 will also require the researcher shall have the participant complete the&nbsp;<a href="../_files/research-participant-compensation.log.xlsx">Acknowledgement of Research Participant Compensation form.</a> <strong>Historically, the majority of research projects at Chapman do not meet this reporting threshold.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because of the sensitive data associated with Social Security numbers, these should generally be collected for research payment only when necessary to comply with IRS reporting requirements.&nbsp; For projects that involve collection of SSNs, this should be explained in the protocol.&nbsp; The protocol should indicate that these data will be collected separately from the research records and should describe security measures that will be used to protect subject confidentiality.&nbsp; In addition, the consent form should indicate that subjects will be asked for their SSNs, why this information will be collected, and how it will be protected. <em>NOTE: Researchers should consult with Chapman IS&amp;T for information regarding the storage and transmission of records containing participant SSN#’s.&nbsp; </em></p>
            <p><strong><u>Special Considerations—Chapman University Employees</u></strong></p>
            <p>All payments to Chapman University employees are considered to be taxable income, regardless of the amount of payment.&nbsp; Research personnel are required to communicate the information to Financial Services regularly.&nbsp; Employees receiving participant payments will see this reflected the tax form W-2 at year-end.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><u>Special Considerations—Non-Resident Aliens (NRA)</u></strong></p>
            <p>Because tax and withholding requirements for non-resident aliens are both complex and highly variable, research personnel should exercise discretion before agreeing to pay the visitor for participation.&nbsp; Financial Services must be consulted to determine the tax regulations before payment can be made to these individuals.&nbsp; Unlike other participants, the university may be required to collect tax payments from the participant simultaneous to issuing gift cards.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Reimbursement of Expenses to Participants</h3>
            <p>If a participant&nbsp;has signed an IRB-approved consent form allowing their travel expenses to be paid for by the study, the researcher should obtain funds, pay the participant's expenses, and settle the funds, using a method described above (e.g., petty cash, cash advance).&nbsp;Supporting documentation for the reimbursement should be retained in the departmental records. In order to protect the anonymity of the subject, no receipts should be sent to Accounting.</p>

            <h3>EXCEPTIONS</h3>
            <p>The Sponsored Project Services understands that there may be mitigating circumstances for late preparation of a proposal. In these situations, individual circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and reasonable efforts will be made to review the proposals. However, <em>proposal accuracy cannot be guaranteed if these deadlines are not adhered to, and proposals received after the deadlines cannot be prioritized ahead of proposals that meet the requirements</em>. If a late submission is anticipated, it is important to notify SPS in advance so an appropriate plan can be established. In many instances at least a partial review of the proposal, particularly the administrative and financial sections, can be initiated in an effort to accommodate truncated timelines.</p>
