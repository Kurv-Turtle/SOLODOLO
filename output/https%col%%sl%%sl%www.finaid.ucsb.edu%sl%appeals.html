      <p>The Financial Aid Application doesn’t always tell the whole story, and for that reason, Congress has granted Financial Aid Administrators the authority to evaluate special circumstances on a <strong>case-by-case </strong>basis. Students must provide adequate documentation to show why their circumstances warrant special treatment. To that end, our office has developed several appeal forms to provide a common means for students to report their circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>While Congress has given Financial Aid Administrators a large amount of freedom in making professional judgment decisions, there are firm limits to this power. We are permitted to make changes to data elements submitted on the Financial Aid Application (i.e. Adjusted Gross Income, Dependency Status, etc.), but we are not allowed to alter the EFC (expected family contribution) formula that the application uses. This distinction rules out certain types of adjustments that are frequently sought by students and families including: Cost of Living Adjustments, Bankruptcy, and Consumer Debt. These situations may have a real impact on a families’ ability to pay for college, but as they do not pertain to data collected on the application, Financial Aid Administrators are unable to consider them.</p>
      <p>The descriptions below outline the appeal processes used by our office. If you are unable to discern which appeal you should file, or if you have a situation you wish to be considered that appears to fall outside of these appeals, we encourage you to contact our office and speak to a Financial Aid Administrator to decide on the best course of action.&nbsp;<a href="visit-us">Visit us</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="contact-us" aria-label="Contact Us Information">contact us</a>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, the information and data provided on the FAFSA or CA Dream Act Application does not accurately reflect a family's current circumstances. Situations that impact a student or family's ability to contribute to the cost of education may be reevaluated. These special circumstances are listed below.<br><br><strong>The 2021-2022 appeal is no longer available.<br> The 2022-2023 appeal will be available on June 30th.<br> </strong></p>
        <h3><strong>Reviewable</strong><strong>&nbsp;special circumstances typically include:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
         <li> Loss of employment</li>
         <li>Loss or reduction in income</li>
         <li>Exclusions of one-time sources of income received</li>

        <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Processing Timeline</strong></h3> Processing times will depend on when the appeal was submitted and whether or not we need additional documentation in order to process the appeal. Generally, it could take anywhere between 3-6 weeks for processing. During our busy periods, its possible that it could take longer.
        <br>
        <h3>Processed Appeals</h3> Once processed, it will take our office 7-10 business days to generate a new award letter to the student. The new award letter will be posted to My Aid Status, once available.

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Cost of Attendance Appeal</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> A student can request a Cost of Attendance Appeal if they believe the <a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance">Cost of Attendance</a> used in determining their total financial aid was not sufficient to cover their actual expenses. Award increases for approved Cost of Attendance Appeals will usually be in the form of additional loan eligibility.<br><strong><br> The 2021-2022 appeal is available now.<br> <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">The 2022-2023 appeal will be available on September 1, 2022.</span></strong></p>
        <h2>Regular Cost of Attendance Appeals</h2>
        <h3>The following expenses can be considered for Cost of Attendance Appeals:</h3>
        <ul>
         <li> Rent </li>
         <li>Food </li>
         <li> Transportation </li>
         <li> Medical/Dental Expenses </li>
         <li> Books/Supplies</li>
         <li>Computer/Equipment needed for school</li>
         <li> Personal Expenses </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> The following expenses are not considered for Cost of Attendance Appeals:</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Security deposit for housing</li>
         <li>Car payments, car insurance, and repairs</li>
         <li>Graduate and professional conference fees or travel</li>
         <li>Resume preparation and job interviews</li>
         <li>Expenses incurred prior to the beginning of the current academic year</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <h3><strong>How it Works</strong></h3>
        <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">If a Cost of Attendance Appeal is approved, you will be notified and your budget will be increased to make room for additional aid, typically in the form of federal loan funding. Due to annual limits on Federal Sub/Unsubsidized loans, it is possible that your eligibility will be restricted to PLUS loans or private student loans.</p>
        <h3>Eligibility&nbsp;</h3>
        <ul>
         <li data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Have already received a Financial Aid Award Letter from our office</li>

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Financial Aid recipients are expected to meet the minimum academic standards set forth by the university. Students that fail to do so are placed on Financial Aid suspension and become ineligible for all Financial Aid programs for one year. Students have the right to appeal this suspension status. A successful appeal will allow the student to be placed on Financial Aid probation and have their eligibility reinstated immediately. These students will then be monitored on a quarterly basis to ensure they are meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. <a href="eligibility#satisfactory-academic-progress">Read more about Satisfactory Academic Progress</a>. </p>
        <p> Students placed on suspension will be notified by email and given directions for accessing the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form <a href="https://ucsb.verifymyfafsa.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><span style="background-color: #ffc000;">Please do not mail in physical appeals. We are only processing appeals that are submitted electronically through our document website listed above.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><strong>SAP appeals for each quarter are due by the last day of instruction for that quarter. Keep in mind that the fee deadline for each term is much earlier.&nbsp;</strong> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Work-Study Appeal</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Undergraduate and Graduate students may appeal to be considered for Work-Study or to increase their current Work-Study award. Work-Study Appeals are evaluated case by case based on financial need and availability of Work-Study funds. </p>
        <p> If a Work-Study Appeal is approved, Work-Study will be added to your award or your existing Work-Study award will be increased. Your loan eligibility would also be decreased to compensate. <br><br> The availability of Work-Study Appeals is dependent upon the funding levels of the Work-Study Program.&nbsp;The appeal process is available through the Award Letter tab in My Aid Status, below the Awards section.</p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Dependency Override Appeal</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Student aid programs operate under the idea that it is primarily the family’s responsibility to pay for a student’s education. The financial aid application attempts to measure the family’s financial strength, and then uses this information to determine the types of aid for which the student is eligible. For this reason, the application may ask for information from the applicant’s parents. </p>
        <p> The financial aid application uses a series of <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency" class="out">dependency questions </a>to determine whether or not a student is required to submit parental information. Students determined to be dependent must provide parental information, while students determined to be independent do not need to provide parental information. </p>
        <p> Financial Aid Administrators may do dependency overrides on a <strong>case-by-case</strong> basis for students with unusual circumstances.</p>
        <h3>Unusual circumstances include:</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Abandonment by parents</li>
         <li>An abusive family environment that threatens the student's health or safety</li>
         <li>The student being unable to locate their parents, etc.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These circumstances must be documented by an objective third party (e.g., pastor, high school or college counselor, a social service agency official, etc.) in order to qualify for this professional judgment treatment. </p>
        <h3><strong>None of the conditions listed below qualify as unusual circumstances:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Parents refuse to contribute to the student's education</li>
         <li>Parents are unwilling to provide information on the application or for verification</li>
         <li>Parents do not claim the student as a dependent for income tax purposes.</li>
         <li>Student demonstrates total self-sufficiency</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The Professional Judgment Dependency Override Appeal is located on the document <a href="https://ucsb.verifymyfafsa.com/">website</a>.<br><strong><br> </strong></p>
