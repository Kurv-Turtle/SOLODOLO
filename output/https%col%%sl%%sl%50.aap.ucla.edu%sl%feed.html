			<p>Most recently, Dr. D’Artagnan Scorza, was a panelist for an AAP 50th anniversary event titled “Life After COVID-19”. He believes that education can be used as a tool for civic and social empowerment in order to advance justice in communities. Currently serving as the inaugural Executive Director of Racial Equity for Los Angeles County, Dr. Scorza’s work has centered on building leaders who fight for equity in communities and schools. He founded and was the Executive Director of the Social Justice Learning Institute and served on the Inglewood Unified School District as President of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>Dr. Scorza serves as a lecturer in the Fielding School of Public Health at UCLA, is a UC Regent Emeritus and is the current President of the UCLA Alumni Association. In these roles, he helped pass policies that established veterans’ services centers and prioritized $160 million for student services across UC campuses. He also improved sustainability in Inglewood schools by helping to secure $350 million to support school construction efforts.</p>
<p>As a US Navy Iraq War Veteran, Dr. Scorza believes that being a responsible leader means setting a strong personal example. Upon returning to his hometown of Inglewood from his tour in Iraq, he was eager to help youth in his community by expanding literacy programs, helping more teens to graduate high school and pursue higher education. Dr. Scorza created the Urban Scholars program to help train students to be social justice youth leaders while receiving opportunities for academic support, career pathway guidance, personal growth and college scholarships. Students who complete this program have a 95% graduation rate from high school, and 85% of those are successfully accepted into college. He also wrote and co-authored articles that focused on improving literacy practices for youth of color in urban communities.</p>
<p>For his work paving the way in advocacy, policy and philanthropy, he was recognized as one of the 40 Emerging Civic Leaders under 40 in 2018 and he received the UCLA Recent Graduate Achievement Award in 2016. He is an Education Pioneers Fellow and a Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE) Fellow, working to end discrimination against people in rural and urban communities by supporting them in their endeavors to start businesses and buy homes. He also serves on the National Science Foundation’s PATHSUP Advisory Board, supporting workforce development for innovative and cost-effective technologies that heal chronic diseases in underserved areas.</p>
<p>Dr. Scorza has been quoted multiple times in publications such as The New York Times, LA Times, ABC News and ESPN about his work, and has been featured in LA Magazine and Huffington Post, and on several podcasts. He is a regular speaker and presenter on topics including equipping leaders to return to their communities to serve, how to help communities thrive, and advancing racial and social justice. He and his family enjoy taking family camping trips and spending time outdoors as often as possible.</p>

			<p>U.S. Rep. Laura Richardson, California District 55, is a powerful player in politics, having served at all three levels of government in a single year.</p>
<p>Richardson was lucky enough to discover her passion at a young age. Growing up during the ’60s, she suffered the discrimination particular to biracial families. She recalls her mother attempting to explain the bizarre behavior of those who disapproved of the family. Richardson’s mother told the six-year-old that she would need to grow up to make better laws. From that day forward, Richardson set her sights upon becoming a member of Congress, citing such outstanding role models as U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-New York, who served seven terms spanning three decades, and U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, D-Texas, who served from 1973-79.</p>

			<p><strong>How did you first get involved with AAP? </strong><br />
<u>Saul:</u> My connection with AAP began with the Transfer Summer Program (TSP). I transferred from junior college and there was a lot to learn about life and classes at UCLA. I started TSP in August and it was the most important step I could have taken at UCLA. I established friendships and relationships through TSP and AAP. AAP gave me confidence and was critical to my UCLA experience and how I was able to succeed academically. There were other Latinos there and that made me feel good. I had people I could connect with that looked like me and that’s important.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to you to be a part of AAP’s history, which now spans back 50 years? </strong><br />
<u>Saul:</u> I feel proud. I am part of an organization that has done so much to help the Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC) community. Not only that, but AAP helps those that are in high financial need as well. I feel proud to know that AAP has impacted the lives of over 60,000 individuals at UCLA.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; width: 300px;" src="https://50.aap.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Campbell-Hall-Photo.jpg" /><strong>What was your favorite memory of AAP? </strong><br />
<u>Saul:</u> My favorite memory would have to be the F/TSP program. I have so many memories of tutoring sessions and even hang out sessions in Campbell Hall and the patio. I did tutor, but I also loved my time in Campbell Hall to catch up with my friends.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you choose to give back to AAP?</strong><br />
<u>Saul: </u> I have a desire to help people like me and I believe it’s important to pay it forward. I want to support organizations that align with my values. I understand the importance of supporting students in pursuing higher education, but I know that AAP goes above and beyond education – it provides that social interaction, community, and those connections that transform the life experience for these students. I see how society is still unequal, so I feel it’s important that we support AAP’s success so they can level that playing field for the generations to come. I ultimately want to support the program that made such a difference in my life.</p>
