       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> <strong>Cal Grants</strong> are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). To be eligible for a Cal Grant, you must: </p>
        <ul>
         <li> Be <a href="/faq#am-i-eligible-to-apply-for-financial-aid">eligible for Financial Aid</a> </li>
         <li> Be a California resident or AB540 eligible student attending an eligible school in California on at least a half-time basis </li>
         <li> Not have received a prior Bachelor's degree </li>
         <li> Meet the satisfactory academic progress standards as determined by the institution </li>
         <li> Not be in default on a federal student loan or owe a refund on a federal or state grant </li>

         <li> Meet the minimum GPA requirement as determined by CSAC </li>

        <h3>Types of Cal Grants</h3>
        <p> <strong>Cal Grant A</strong> is awarded to students from low- and middle- income families. It provides tuition assistance only. At a UC, it pays the mandatory fees charged to all UC students. It does not cover the campus-based fees (or "student services fees") that vary from campus to campus. </p>
        <p> <strong>Cal Grant B</strong> is awarded to students from disadvantaged and low-income families. In the first year of eligibility, it only provides an Access Grant. In the second through fourth years, it provides fee assistance in addition to the Access Grant. </p>
        <p> Students enrolled less than full-time (12 units) on census date (one day after the last day to add classes on GOLD) will have their Cal Grant for that quarter reduced to a level that reflects their enrollment level. For example, a student enrolled in 10 units will have that quarter’s Cal Grant reduced to a 3/4-time award. This may necessitate billing back Financial Aid already received. </p>

        <p> Cal Grant B&nbsp;recipients will automatically have their full Access award applied to their BARC account to pay any outstanding balances. Alternatively, students may elect to receive the full disbursement of their Access award directly, to use towards educational expenses not charged by BARC. If you would like to choose this alternative method please contact the Cal Grant Coordinator to process this request. Additionally, students have the ability to change their disbursement method at any time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>New Applicants&nbsp;</strong>must file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or California Dream Act Application and a GPA Verification Form by March 2 prior to the academic year for which the award is intended. CSAC determines eligibility for new awards and notifies the eligible institution(s) listed on the FAFSA of these awards. If you have not attended UCSB or you have completed less than 36 units at UCSB, you will be required to submit a GPA Verification Form. (This is if you are currently not receiving the Cal Grant) </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <strong>Renewal Applicants</strong> must file the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application, demonstrate financial need, and not exceed the income and asset ceilings established by CSAC.

         UCSB Scholarship is made available by the University of California and is awarded to California resident undergraduate applicants considered On-Time and determined to have sufficient financial need.

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">UC Health Insurance Grant</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p>All UCSB students are automatically enrolled in and charged for UC Health Insurance unless they submit an approved insurance waiver with the Student Health Insurance Office. This grant helps cover the cost of UC Health Insurance for the academic year and the amount of this grant is dependent upon your financial need. Students who opt out of UC Health Insurance will not be eligible to receive the grant. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships will not consider any appeals from students who waive out.</p>
        <p>If you do waive out of UC Health Insurance, your total financial aid will still include the full cost of the Gaucho Access Plan (GAP) in order to ensure students have adequate funding to sign up for that program.

       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> The <strong>Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan</strong> is a Financial Aid Initiative for University of California undergraduate students. The goal of the new “Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan” is to ensure that UC system-wide fees do not deter the half of California households with incomes below $80,000 from aspiring to a UC education. </p>
        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p> To be eligible for the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, you must: </p>
        <ul>
         <li> Be a California resident </li>
         <li> Submit a FAFSA and provide all requested documents. For more information, visit <a href="/how-to-apply">Applying</a> </li>
         <li> Apply for a Cal Grant (if not already a recipient) </li>
         <li> Demonstrate sufficient financial need </li>
         <li> Have income below $80,000. For dependent students, this refers to your parent's income. For independent students, this refers to the combined income of you and your spouse </li>
         <li> Be in your first four years (two if a transfer student) of University undergraduate attendance </li>
         <li> Meet basic requirements for UC grant assistance </li>
        </ul>
        <p> No student will receive more scholarship and grant support than the calculated financial need. All sources of scholarship and grant awards (federal, state, institutional, and private sources, including outside agency scholarships) will count towards covering fees and meeting the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan commitment. The majority of students who meet the income eligibility standard will already have sufficient grant and scholarship support to cover full UC system-wide fees based on our standard Financial Aid packaging guidelines. Students can receive only one fee paying resource. For example, if a student is receiving Cal Grant, the student would not be eligible for Blue and Gold.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> In addition to the minimum funding under the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, undergraduates with sufficient financial need will receive additional grant support to help defray other educational expenses (e.g.: books, living expenses, transportation, etc.). </p>
