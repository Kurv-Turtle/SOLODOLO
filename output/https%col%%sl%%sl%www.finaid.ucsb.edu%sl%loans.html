       <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">UCSB participates in the Federal Direct Loan program. Funds for Direct Loans are provided by the U.S. government directly to students. These loans have low fixed interest rates and a variety of deferment and flexible repayment options. Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans do not require a credit check and/or collateral.</p>
       <p>We strongly encourage students to use the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=fa">Financial Awareness Counseling</a> tool available through the <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action">Federal Student Aid website</a> to help manage their student loan related debt.</p>

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Federal Direct Student Loan</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p>All Direct Loans are either Subsidized or Unsubsidized. With <strong>Subsidized</strong> loans, interest does not accrue until after students graduate or leave school. To receive a Subsidized Direct Loan, you must have financial need. </p>
        <p>With <strong>Unsubsidized</strong> loans, interest begins to accrue after the first disbursement. We recommend that students make payments on the interest while they are in school to reduce the total loan balance at the point of graduation.</p>
        <p>Many students combine Subsidized loans with Unsubsidized loans to borrow the maximum amount permitted each year. </p>

        <p><strong>Interest Rate and Origination Fee</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans">View the Federal Student Loans: Repaying Your Loans Guide</a> </p>
        <p>The interest rate for Federal Direct Student Loans depends on when the loan was first disbursed. Visit the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#rates">Federal Student Aid Interest Rates</a> for information about current and past rates. Interest rates are determined each spring for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.</p>
        <p>The Department of Education charges an "Origination fee" on all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The loan fee is a percentage of the loan amount and is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement. See the<a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#fees"> Federal Student Aid Loan Fees </a>for the current percentages. </p>
        <p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>
        <p>To apply for either the Subsidized or Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, you must: </p>
        <ol>
         <li><a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/how-to-apply">Apply for Financial Aid</a></li>
         <li>Accept your Federal Direct Loan through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/aidstatus">My Aid Status</a></li>
         <li>Complete a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=entrance">Direct Loan Entrance Counseling</a></li>
         <li>Complete a Subsidized/Unsubsidized <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/launchMpn.action">Master Promissory Note</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>As long as your requirements are completed, Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans generally take 3-5 business days to disburse to your BARC (billing) account.</p>
        <p><strong>Exit Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>When you graduate or permanently leave UCSB, you must complete the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=exit">Direct Loan Exit Counseling.</a></p>
        <p><strong>Repayment </strong></p>
        <p>Repayment for subsidized and unsubsidized Direct Loans begins six months after a student leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment. Information about your loans is submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), which is the database where you may view your entire federal loan history. Please visit<a href="https://nslds.ed.gov"> NSLDS </a>to view your borrowed loan amounts, disbursement dates, and who your federal loan servicer is as well as their contact information. The federal loan servicer is assigned by the Department of Education, and they handle matters related to billing and repayment of your loans. If you have questions about changing your <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans">repayment plan</a>, <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/launchConsolidation.action">loan consolidation</a>, or if you qualify for <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation">loans forgiveness</a>, please talk to your servicer. </p>
        <p>We suggest you utilize Federal Student Aid’s <a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/repaymentEstimator.action">Repayment Estimator</a> while you are in school to see approximately how much a month you will owe post-graduation. </p>

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p>The U.S. Department of Education makes Direct PLUS Loans to eligible parents of dependent students. Unlike the Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans borrowed by students, the Parent PLUS Loan requires a credit check that is valid for 180 days.</p>
        <h3>How to Apply</h3>
        <p>To apply for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, you must:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Determine the PLUS loan eligibility amount which is shown on the Financial Aid Award Letter. Parents will need to check availability with their student.</li>
         <li>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/">Studentaid.gov</a>&nbsp;and log in with the&nbsp;"parent"&nbsp;FSA ID. Make sure to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span>&nbsp;log in as the&nbsp;student.</li>
         <li>Proceed to “<a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing?redirectTo=%2Fplus-app%2Fparent">Apply for a PLUS Loan</a>”. Two important things to know is the amount you wish to borrow and the method of disbursement (see options below).</li>
         <li>Complete a Parent PLUS&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/launchMpn.action?mpnType=parentPlusMpn">Master Promissory Note</a>&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If approved, our office will receive an electronic update of your completed loan application. Generally, we receive this information within 5-7 business days.</p>
        <h3>Denied Applications</h3><strong> </strong>
        <p>The parent is notified immediately after applying whether they are approved or denied. If the credit check leads to a denial, parents have the following options:</p>
        <ol>
         <li><strong>Appeal:</strong>&nbsp;Log into&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/demoAppealCreditDecision.action">Studentaid.gov</a>&nbsp;and select “Document Extenuating Circumstances” and follow the instructions.</li>
         <li><strong>Endorse:</strong> Obtain an&nbsp;<cite>endorser</cite>&nbsp;who does not have an adverse credit history. An endorser is someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if you cannot repay it.&nbsp;Have the endorser create an FSA ID, and then log into&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/endorser-addendum/">Studentaid.gov</a>&nbsp;and select “Endorse a PLUS Loan”. If the loan was endorsed or you completed a successful credit appeal, complete the PLUS Counseling through&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=plus">Studentaid.gov</a>.</li>
         <li><strong>Request Additional Unsubsidized Student Loan:</strong> Have your student apply for additional Loan funds instead of acting on the parent PLUS loan. Download and submit the Request for Additional Unsubsidized Loan form found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/forms">Forms</a>&nbsp;tab of our website.</li>
        </ol><strong>*</strong>With either option 1 or 2, you also must complete “PLUS Counseling” on StudentAid.gov&nbsp; 
        <h3><strong>Interest Rate and Origination Fee</strong></h3>
        <p>The interest rate depends on when the loan was first disbursed. Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent#interest">Federal Student Aid website</a>&nbsp;for information about current and past interest rates. Interest rates are determined each spring for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.</p>
        <p>The Department of Education charges an "Origination fee" on all Direct PLUS Loans. The loan fee is a percentage of the loan amount and is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent#fees">Federal Student Aid website</a>&nbsp;for the current loan fee percentages.</p>
        <h3><strong>Disbursement</strong></h3>
        <p>While applying for the loan, parents will be given two disbursement options. In order to receive your funds in a timely manner, we strongly encourage you to select the <strong>“student”</strong> disbursement option. If you chose “me”, the borrower and would like to change the disbursement method to “student”, you can complete our Parent PLUS Loan Adjustment Form found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/Forms">Forms</a>&nbsp;tab of our website. The two different disbursement options are:</p>
        <ol>
         <li><strong>STUDENT&nbsp;</strong>(highly recommended)<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>If you indicated on the application that you want the money to go to “the student", then the PLUS funds will credit to the student's BARC account. Those funds first pay any university fees and the remaining amount is then "refunded" to the student. The earliest these funds will be released to the student is 10 days before the start of the quarter.</li>
         <li><strong>BORROWER:&nbsp;</strong>If you chose the "me" (the parent borrower), one of the following options will occur: 
          <ol>
           <li>If the loan’s quarterly amount is&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less</span></strong>&nbsp;than your&nbsp;<strong>student’s BARC balance</strong>&nbsp;at the time of disbursement, the loan may be paid to the student’s BARC account.</li>
           <li>If the loan’s quarterly amount is&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span></strong>&nbsp;than the BARC balance, UCSB will send the entire loan amount to you, the parent borrower, via paper check in the mail. These checks are not mailed until after the quarterly fee payment deadline with the BARC Office. Please ensure that your student’s BARC account is paid or deferred prior to the payment deadline.</li>
          </ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><strong>Repayment</strong></h3>
        <p>Repayment begins 60 days after the final disbursement of the loan. During the application process, a parent can also choose to defer repayment until 6 months after the student graduates or leaves school.<br><br> Information about your loan is submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), which is the database where you may view your entire federal loan history. Please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans">studentaid.gov&nbsp;</a>to view your total borrowed loan amounts, disbursement dates, and your federal loan servicer. The federal loan servicer is assigned by the Department of Education, and they handle matters related to billing and repayment of your loans.

      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Private Student Loans</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Private student loans can help to fill the gap between the cost of education and the amount of other Financial Aid awarded. These loans are provided by private lenders for students who need to borrow funds in excess of the yearly maximums for the federal loan programs. Most lenders will take applicant's credit history into consideration when evaluating applicant's eligibility. Students may be eligible for these loans which have varying criteria (interest rates, minimum monthly repayments, etc.). They are not federally guaranteed student loans. </p>
        <p> Students have the right and the ability to select the private loan lender of their choice. We highly recommend that students exhaust their Federal Direct Loan eligibility <strong>before</strong> pursuing funds through a private education loan. Also, be aware that parents of dependent students are able to borrow up to the complete cost of education through the Federal Direct PLUS Loan program. </p>
        <p> Federal Direct Student Loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide. </p>
        <p> To start your search, the UC Office of the President has put together a list of recommended lenders. You are not required to use any of the lenders on the list. They are simply provided for your convenience. Per HEOA guidelines, our office adheres to the <a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/codeofconduct.pdf?sfvrsn=a945018a_0" class="out">UC Student Loan Code of Conduct</a>.

        </ul>
        <h3>Self-Certification Form</h3>
        <p> In order to receive loan proceeds, you must apply to the lender directly. </p>

        <p> For the <strong>estimated financial assistance</strong> amount required in Section 2B of the form, total the awarded amounts from your award letter.</p>
