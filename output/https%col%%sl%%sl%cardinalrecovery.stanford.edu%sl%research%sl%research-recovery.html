In Stage 1, a small number of researchers will (a) prepare labs and units for a gradual return to work in Stage 2 and (b) prepare to train the next group that will be coming in to work.<\/p>\n<p>When Stage 1 began, the density limit was set at two (2) personnel per faculty member per shift. On June 5th, 2020, the density cap was extended to 4 people per faculty member per shift, provided that (a) the laboratory room has at least 250 square feet per person, and (b) the local unit approves the faculty member going to this density. The lab SOP must include <a href=\"https:\/\/healthalerts.stanford.edu\/covid-19\/prevention-care\/social-distancing-protocol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">physical distancing protocols<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In Stage 1, only one person at a time may occupy rooms with areas &lt;250 square feet (e.g., tissue culture rooms, microscopy rooms, small instrument rooms, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>In Stage 1, researchers may not extend the types of research beyond Essential Research Functions, COVID-19-related work, and Minimum Basic Research Operations (<a href=\"\/research\/research-recovery\/#laboratory-research.2\">as defined in Stage 0<\/a>), and they may not exceed the density limit outlined above.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-laboratory-density\"><em>Managing Laboratory Density<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Some situations may require that two people work in closer proximity than 6 feet, for example while operating a piece of equipment (e.g., starting up an NMR machine), performing necessary experimental steps (e.g., surgeries requiring two researchers), and safety activities (e.g., working with cryogens, transporting heavy equipment, providing aid in case of a potential incident\/exposure). In these instances, personnel should maximize distance where possible, minimize time in proximity where possible (without rushing), and coordinate and collaborate on logistics before and during the work process.<\/p>\n<p>Physical distancing should <strong>not<\/strong> be discarded for convenience, such as to simply allow more people to work in a smaller space. PIs must cooperate to ensure that they do not exceed these density limits in shared spaces. We recommend that researchers establish a shared calendar for spaces belonging to 2 or more faculty members.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers should occupy (at most) only every other work space (bay, bench, etc., depending on the lab layout) and remain at least 6 feet apart. Pairs of researchers should not occupy work spaces directly opposite one another at the same time if the distance between those work spaces is &lt;6 feet. Laboratory managers may place short partitions between researchers who work facing one another. Any permanent installation must be reviewed by the facility or building manager, and may require coordination with and approval from <a href=\"https:\/\/ehs.stanford.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EH&amp;S<\/a>. <strong>Installation of such partitions does not negate the need to wear face coverings and maintain adequate physical distancing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wherever possible, researchers who share shifts should work in the same groups consistently to limit the number of cross-shift contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We strongly encourage units (schools, departments, institutes, and buildings) to disallow late shifts and to establish limits on scheduled shifts. For example, we recommend that no scheduled shifts occur between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., with minor exceptions for timed experiments, because these shifts frequently correspond with higher rates of injury and exposure, and safety personnel are less available at those times. These exceptions need approvals from the PI and\/or the department.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"non-laboratory-areas\"><em>Non-Laboratory Areas<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Academic units should comply with general campus recovery plans.

Because members of the research team may be concerned that their research and degree progress, relationship with their PI, status in the lab, future opportunities may be negatively impacted if they do not participate in the research, they may participate in research even if they do not feel safe or comfortable doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, PIs should: (1) ensure that team members are aware of whom they should contact if they have <a href=\"\/research\/research-recovery\/#research-recovery-introduction.1\">safety or health concerns<\/a> (see below under \u201cConcerns about safety and non-compliance\u201d), (2) remember that participating in research as a subject must always be voluntary, (3) provide opportunities for alternative projects if members of the research team are concerned about their safety with in-person human subjects protocols.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure willingness to participate, volunteers should be solicited by students or staff rather than by PIs or immediate supervisors, and the identities of those who have volunteered or declined to volunteer should be kept confidential.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vulnerability of researchers and study participants:<\/strong> Although new data are emerging, specific characteristics appear to be associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/need-extra-precautions\/people-at-increased-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased vulnerability<\/a> to transmitting and contracting COVID-19. If possible, these vulnerable individuals should not participate in in-person human subjects research as researchers or participants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Concerns about safety and non-compliance:<\/strong> Members of the research team who have concerns about their own safety and\/or the safety of others, or concerns about noncompliance have several options. Individuals may discuss these concerns with their PI. If this is not possible, individuals should discuss with the local contact appointed by their department or unit (e.g., department administrator). Individuals who have safety concerns may contact <a href=\"https:\/\/ehs.stanford.edu\/report-safety-concern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EH&amp;S<\/a>.

Some decisions that are intended to address one need may inadvertently result in inequities (e.g., providing one group access to their offices may make it harder for another group to begin their research).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Research outdoors:<\/strong> The risk of spread of transmission is lower outdoors than indoors, and therefore, research studies that can take place outdoors in approved and authorized spaces are encouraged (<a href=\"\/research\/research-recovery\/#policies.2\">Group Meeting Policy<\/a>). Departments and units can contact schools for guidelines in creating designated \u201coutdoor safety zones\u201d near their buildings. If approved by the department and\/or school, these outdoor safety zones may be used for conducting allowable human subjects research.

Research methods are correspondingly diverse, including the study of documents carried out by individuals in libraries and archives (both on and off campus), fieldwork performed at outside institutions that are governed by their own constraints and regulations, lab-based digital experiments conducted by research teams, and studio work done by creative artists. Outcomes often involve some form of public presentation, such as public lectures, international conferences, concerts, theatrical presentations and exhibitions. Some of this research overlaps with activities performed in other parts of the university; some is unique to the humanities and arts cluster; and some is quite specific to a particular unit or department.<\/p>\n<p>Research activities dovetail in substantial and significant ways with teaching; this overlap obtains in particular in the arts, where both research and teaching often require performance spaces and involve gatherings of varying sizes, from small groups to a full symphony orchestra.
