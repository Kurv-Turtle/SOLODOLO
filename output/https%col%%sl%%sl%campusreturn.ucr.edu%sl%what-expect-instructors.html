  <meta name="description" content="Guidance for In-person Instruction at UC Riverside for 2021-22 Background UCR returned to primarily in-person instruction in fall 2021, with more than 80% of our courses meeting in person. After two weeks of remote instruction to begin the winter quarter, about 95% of courses are expected to meet in person. This return was predicated on widespread vaccination within our campus community. According to current UCOP guidelines, if at least 90% of on-campus students, faculty, and staff are fully vaccinated, then UCR can operate under the CDC definition of a “fully vaccinated campus.” Our current vaccination rate is nearly 96%, and this document has been developed by the Instructional Continuity Workgroup (ICW) to help instructors prepare for and deliver their in-person courses, assuming this trend continues.&nbsp;">

                      <h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>
                      <p>UCR returned to primarily in-person instruction in fall 2021, with more than 80% of our courses meeting in-person. After&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220203195416/https://insideucr.ucr.edu/announcements/2022/01/07/extension-remote-instruction">four weeks of remote instruction</a>&nbsp;to begin the winter quarter, about 95% of courses are expected to meet in person.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>These FAQs were developed by the Instructional Continuity Workgroup (ICW) to help instructors prepare for and deliver their in-person courses during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                      <p>The ICW established five principles to guide our return to in-person instruction:</p>
                      <ol>
                       <li>Prioritize the health and safety of all members of our campus community.</li>
                       <li>Extend in-person education to the greatest extent possible, consistent with our mission as a residential R1 research university.</li>
                       <li>Balance consistent decision-making at the campus level with appropriate pedagogical flexibility at the department/program level.</li>
                       <li>Communicate clearly with the campus community.</li>
                       <li>Prepare to adapt to ever-changing conditions.</li>

                        <p>Consistent with public health guidelines, classroom cleaning will return to pre-COVID schedules and standards. There is broad scientific consensus that the primary mode of virus transmission is through exposure to airborne respiratory droplets. Infection risk due to surface transmission is considered to be low. Therefore, rooms and shared equipment will be deep-cleaned and/or disinfected by Facilities only when deemed necessary by a case investigation. However, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes will be available and routinely checked in all teaching spaces. Please encourage students to take advantage of these supplies and use them according to directions for maximum efficiency.&nbsp; If you notice any empty supplies, you may submit a work order&nbsp;<a href="https://facilities.ucr.edu/requests">here&nbsp;</a>or by calling 827-4214. In addition, you may provide your own teaching equipment, if desired, rather than sharing high-touch items. Please do not use your own cleaning products in classrooms as these may damage the equipment.</p>

                        <p>Instructors are not responsible for monitoring the health status of their students or making decisions about suspending in-person instruction. If a student tests positive, the COVID Management Team will be notified when the student submits their COVID Screening Check. The student is not obligated to directly notify you of the positive test (see&nbsp;<a href="https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/what-expect-instructors#what_will_happen_if_a_student_in_my_class_tests_positive_for_covid19_">related FAQ</a>&nbsp;about a student notifying an instructor of a positive test). The COVID Management Team will initiate a&nbsp;<a href="https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/case-reporting-and-investigation">case investigation</a>. Notices will be posted on UCR’s COVID-19&nbsp;<a href="https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/dashboards">dashboard</a>, you will receive an email if you are teaching in an affected room, and close contacts (identified through case investigation) also will be notified via email.</p>
                        <p>Students who are instructed to isolate or quarantine based on the findings of the case investigation may contact you to discuss options for continuing to make progress in your class during this time (see&nbsp;<a href="https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/what-expect-instructors#do_i_have_to_provide_a_remote_option_for_students_who_are_symptomatic_test_positive_for_covid19_or_must_quarantine_due_to_close_contact_">related FAQ</a>&nbsp;about offering remote options to such students). Student Health Services will provide these students with a “COVID Awareness Letter” that can be shared with instructors for verification.</p>
                        <p>You should not suspend in-person instruction for all students because of a positive test, a case investigation, or a group of students in isolation or quarantine. However, COVID Management Team will notify the Registrar if your classroom must be temporarily closed for cleaning or disinfection in accordance with CDC guidelines. In the unlikely event that this happens, the Registrar will notify all affected instructors (including TAs), deans, department chairs/program directors, and academic scheduling coordinators. You will be responsible for notifying your students. Cleaning and disinfection typically require less than 24 hours, and you may teach remotely during this time. When your classroom re-opens, you should return to in-person instruction. Generally, if you have not been directed to suspend in-person instruction by the COVID Management Team, the central campus administration, or your dean, you should continue teaching in-person.</p>

                        <p>You are not obligated to provide a remote option. However, if you adopt a strict approach that limits all remote access to your course, students may feel additional pressure to attend class when they are symptomatic, or to fail to report a positive test or close contact. Therefore, instructors are encouraged to be flexible and seek compromises to help protect public health on campus and our ability to offer in-person instruction and other activities. If you find yourself in an untenable situation, such as the unlikely event that a large number of students must quarantine for an extended period of time, contact your chair to discuss options but do not unilaterally suspend in-person instruction. If a solution that maintains in-person instruction cannot be found at the department level, escalate to your dean.</p>
                        <p>If a student has an especially prolonged case of COVID, as determined by Student Health Services, the student may have the option to register with the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) and receive formal disability accommodations. The SDRC is available to answer your questions and offer guidance in these situations.</p>

                        <p>Instructors should complete a <strong>Field Safety Plan</strong> before teaching off-campus. To complete the plan, visit the "Documents and Forms" section on the <a href="https://ehs.ucr.edu/laboratory/field">Field Safety Site</a>.</p>
                        <p>Participants in off-site instructional activities generally should follow the same requirements as on-site, including completion of the <a href="wellnesscheck.ucr.edu">COVID Screening Check</a>, face coverings when indoors, testing, etc., that are outlined on the <a href="https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/">campus return site</a>.<br><br> Also follow <a href="https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus/travel">current guidance for UCR personnel</a> which indicates that all CDC guidance on travel should be followed.&nbsp;Anyone who leaves the state of California and is not fully vaccinated will be subject to testing and quarantine requirements upon return. Because non-fully vaccinated individuals are more at risk, especially when traveling to areas with higher virus transmission risk, instructors should consider if alternatives that do not require travel can be made available to students. For longer, multi-day trips, the instructor should consider how to implement testing and quarantine for anyone who becomes symptomatic.<br><br> Currently there are no restrictions on food and beverage service, but instructors should consider service styles that reduce health risk, including individually packaged food/beverages and boxed meals, and avoiding self-service buffets.</p>

As was the case before the pandemic, a temporary shift to remote instruction is appropriate if an instructor is temporarily unable to teach in-person. For short disruptions, including due to illness, faculty should do what they would have done before the pandemic, whether cancelling a class, offering the class remotely, or giving a small assignment to substitute for the class session. However, in all such instances, faculty should immediately notify their department chair or program director so that their unit is aware of the situation. For potentially longer disruptions, including if a faculty member (or their young children) are instructed by public health to quarantine/isolate for an extended period of time, instructors should confer with their chair and propose a solution to their dean as soon as possible.<br><br> In pivoting to remote instruction, communication with students is critical. Students should be reminded of the possibility at the start of the term so that they may make remote arrangements on their end (i.e., finding a location, wifi, devices, etc.). It is good practice to include this information in your syllabus.</p>

                        <p>Campus provided microphones will be assigned to rooms rather than instructors. The primary mode of COVID-19 infection is through exposure to respiratory droplets and the risk of surface transmission is low. However, all teaching spaces will be supplied with disinfecting wipes which can be used to wipe down shared equipment including microphones (while powered off, and excepting foam windscreens) before and after use. In addition, for rooms equipped with lavalier microphones, instructors may purchase their own wired lapel or “over ear” mic with TA4F jack, and connect this personal equipment to the campus-provided portable transmitter in each room. More details including suggested manufacturers are forthcoming from ITS. For classrooms that are not wired for amplified sound, a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/1938068317">study on sound attenuation</a>&nbsp;from the University of Illinois may be helpful for deciding which kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus/facecoverings">approved face covering</a>&nbsp;you want to use.&nbsp;</p>

However, it may be preferable to schedule guest speakers to participate remotely, both to help protect public health on campus and to hedge against the risk that the campus might later be closed to visitors.&nbsp;</p>
