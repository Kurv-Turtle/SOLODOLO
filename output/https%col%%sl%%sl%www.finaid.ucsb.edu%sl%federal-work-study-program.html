      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">What is Work-Study?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p>Work-Study is a need-based form of Financial Aid that you earn through on- or off-campus employment and receive in the form of a paycheck. </p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Why Work-Study?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> The intent of the Work-Study Program is to encourage your part-time employment and reduce the amount of loan debt incurred while attending college. Work-Study does so by paying a portion of your salary, thus making you a "better financial deal" for your employer. </p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">How do I get Paid?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content">
         Unlike other forms of Financial Aid that you may receive (e.g.: loans, grants, scholarships), your Work-Study award never credits to your BARC account. Your Work-Study award is paid directly to you, as it is earned, through a paycheck. Work-Study payroll cycles are two weeks long, from Sunday to the second following Saturday. A payroll check is issued approximately a week and a half later (e.g. WSP pay period February 3rd - February 16th; check date February 27th). 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">How do I Qualify?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> To qualify for a Work-Study award, a student must file a FAFSA or DREAM Act Application prior to March 2nd and have sufficient financial need. Our office determines your Financial Aid eligibility and notifies you of your aid in a Financial Aid Award Letter, which may include a Work-Study award. </p> 
        <p> Students who submitted a DREAM ACT application and are eligible to receive Work-Study can activate this award only if they obtained a social security number after the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) granted them Deferred Action Status and received an Employment Authorization Card. </p> 
        <p> <strong>Unit Load Requirement:</strong> <br> Additionally, all qualifying Work-Study recipients must maintain a minimum study load of six (6) units each quarter. Students found to have registered below six units at the Census Date will not qualify for Work-Study funding during that quarter. The Census Date occurs one day after the last day to drop classes on Gold. On that date, the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships will take a snap-shot of your unit registration load in Gold. Employers will be notified immediately of changes to your Work-Study eligibility, which may result in the loss of employment. Employers have full discretion concerning whether to keep you employed or not. The Work-Study Unit will gladly re-instate Work-Study funding if you re-enroll in more units after the Census Date. </p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Was I Awarded Work-Study?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Check your Financial Aid Award Letter on <a href="/aidstatus">My Aid Status</a>&nbsp;to confirm your eligibility. If you do not have Work-Study or would like to increase your Work-Study award, you may complete the Work-Study Appeal - the appeal process is available through a link in the Award Letter tab in My Aid Status, below the Awards section. </p>
        <p> Please note, Work-Study is not a requirement to be hired for an on-campus position. Students that have not been awarded Work-Study are still encouraged to look for available positions on <a href="https://career.ucsb.edu/gain-experience/student-jobs/search-for-student-jobs#work-study-header"></a><a href="https://career.ucsb.edu/gain-experience/student-jobs/search-for-student-jobs#work-study-header">UCSB Handshake</a>.</p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">What is a Work-Study Referral? How do I Get One?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content">
         Your Work-Study Referral is the document that verifies you are a Work-Study recipient and authorizes your (prospective) employer(s) to pay you with Work-Study funds. You must present a Work-Study Program Referral to your employer(s) to utilize your Work-Study Eligibility.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Referrals are available 10 days before the first day of Fall quarter instruction and to those award recipients that have either paid or deferred their Fall-quarter fees. You will be able to print your Referral from the Dashboard tab on My Aid Status. 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">How do I Find a Job?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p>Both on-campus and off-campus employers advertise their available Work-Study positions on&nbsp;<a href="https://career.ucsb.edu/gain-experience/student-jobs/search-for-student-jobs#work-study-header">UCSB Handshake</a>. Students may begin to apply and search for positions mid August. All students must have a UCSBNetID to log into Handshake to begin their job search. Access to&nbsp;Handshake is restricted to those students that are officially registered for classes at UCSB or affiliated alumni. </p>
        <p>Once your Official Award Letter is available, you may print it and submit it to your prospective employer as proof of your Work-Study&nbsp;eligibility . If and when you are hired, you must provide a Work-Study Referral form to your employer in order to be hired as a Work-Study student.&nbsp;<br><br> All Work-Study eligible students will be able to print their Work-Study Referral form from the Dashboard of their My Aid Status Account 10 days before the first day of Fall quarter instruction.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Off-campus employers must be pre-approved by the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships. Employers that are interested in participating in the Work-Study Program at UCSB may contact <a href="mailto:sa-finaidwsp@ucsb.edu">finaidwsp@sa.ucsb.edu</a> or visit the <a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/federal-work-study-employers">employer section</a> of our website for information about the program and the application process. Please note that we are only able to accept applications from organizations in the UCSB area at this time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">I Found a Job. How do I Get Hired?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> If you are hired for an <strong>on-campus position</strong>, your employer will: </p>
        <ul>
         <li> Accept your Referral </li>
         <li> Prepare and submit employment paperwork to our office </li>
         <li> Provide you with a time sheet </li>
         <li> Provide you with a job description </li>
         <li> Work with you to create a work schedule </li>
         <li> Train and supervise you, evaluating your job performance. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If you are hired for an approved&nbsp;<strong>off-campus position</strong>, you must schedule an appointment with a Work-Study Program administrator.&nbsp;Once you have your referral packet completed by you and your employer schedule an appointment with the Work Study Unit at finaidwsp@sa.ucsb.edu. A Zoom meeting will be scheduled by the Work-Study Unit.<br><br> Please make sure to email the below items when scheduling your appointment:</p>
        <ul>
         <li> Completed Referral (no signatures required at this time);&nbsp;</li>
         <li>Completed Student Information Sheet;&nbsp;<br> Completed Work-Study Program Student Employee Job Description; </li>
         <li>and Completed Statement of Academic Relevance (required only for For-Profit Agencies)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start dates for working under the Work-Study Program will be set for 1 week from the appointment date. <br><br> After the appointment is complete, the Work-Study Unit will initiate the DocuSign process for students and employers to sign referral packets. Students will need to setup an additional appointment to complete the I-9 verification process; instructions will be included during initial appointment with the Work-Study Unit. <br><br> A Letter of Clearance will be sent to your employer indicating your eligible start date under the Work-Study Program once the process is complete.&nbsp;A Letter of Clearance will not be generated until referral packets have been DocuSigned by both student and employer and student's I-9 verification is complete.&nbsp;</p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Can I Have More than One Work-Study Job?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Yes. If you want to split your Work-Study among multiple Work-Study employers, you may complete the Work-Study Employer Change Request &nbsp;- the process is available through the Work-Study Eligibility section on the Award Letter tab in My Aid Status. </p> 
       </div> </li> 
      <li> <h2 class="expcol-header">Will My Work-Study Award Expire if I Don't Use It?</h2> 
       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p> Your Work-Study will eventually expire if you do not secure employment. You may not carry forward your unearned Work-Study into Summer or the next academic year. </p>
        <p> Should you not secure employment or do not wish to use Work-Study funds, you may convert your unearned Work-Study eligibility to additional&nbsp;Federal Direct or&nbsp; Parent PLUS Loan eligibility. The Work-Study Conversion process is available through the Work-Study Eligibility section on the Award Letter tab in My Aid Status. If Work-Study has been converted to additional loan eligibility, the Office of Financial Aid will determine&nbsp;which additional resource you are&nbsp;eligible &nbsp;to receive and update your Financial Aid Offer.&nbsp;</p>
