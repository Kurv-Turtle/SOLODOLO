        <p>The University of Southern California (“USC” or the “University”) is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for its faculty, staff, students, alumni, volunteers and visitors. The requirements in this policy are designed to facilitate USC’s compliance with the “Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998,” (the “Clery Act”). The Clery Act requires USC to disclose specified crime report statistics on and near its campuses, to provide other safety and crime information to the campus community in an accurate, complete, and timely manner, and to maintain written policies and procedures implementing the Clery Act.&nbsp; To maintain a safe and secure environment for its faculty, staff, students, and visitors, and as a recipient of federal financial aid, the University complies with the provisions of the Clery Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 id="autoid-9v85g">3. Scope and Application</h2>
        <p>This Policy applies broadly to the entire University community, including students who are registered or enrolled in University classes or in one of the University’s degree or non-degree programs (“Students”); all full-time and part-time faculty (“Faculty”); all non-faculty University employees, including University Staff, Keck Medicine employees, professional research staff, and post-doctoral fellows (“Staff”); and contractors, vendors, visitors, guests, or other individuals who are participating in or seeking to participate in the University’s education program or activities (“Third Parties”).</p>

        <h2 id="autoid-5q48k">5. Policy Details</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the requirements of the Clery Act, the University shall:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Publish an Annual Security and Fire Safety Report (ASFSR)</strong></p>
        <p>By October 1st each year (or as otherwise required by the U.S. Department of Education), USC will publish an ASFSR documenting the prior three calendar years of Clery Act crime statistics, security policies and procedures, and information on the basic rights guaranteed to victims of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking. All crime statistics must also be submitted to the U.S. Department of Education’s online portal.</p>
        <p>This report must be made available to all current faculty, staff, and students.&nbsp; In addition, prospective faculty, staff, and students must be notified of the ASFSR’s existence and provided a copy upon request. Paper copies of the report will be available upon request from the USC Department of Public Safety (DPS). In addition, the Office of Admissions and Human Resources will publish a link to the ASFSR with a brief description on their respective web sites.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Identify, Notify, &amp; Train Campus Security Authorities (CSAs)</strong></p>
        <p>USC will identify positions which meet the definition of a CSA on an ongoing basis, and notify individuals in these roles of their obligations under the Clery Act to report any and all alleged Clery Crimes that they witness, or are reported to them, which may have occurred in a Clery Reportable Location.&nbsp; USC requires that all CSAs complete annual training on their responsibilities and reporting requirements under the Clery Act.&nbsp; USC will provide such training on a regular basis&nbsp;through the TrojanLearn learning management system.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Disclose Crime Report Statistics</strong></p>
        <p>Crime report statistics for incidents that occur in Clery Reportable Locations and are reported to Campus Security Authorities must be disclosed in a variety of formats, including the daily crime log, the ASFSR, and through the U.S. Department of Education’s online portal.</p>
        <p>The Clery Act Compliance Coordinator is responsible for gathering crime report statistics from DPS; Office of Professionalism and Ethics (OPE); Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX (EEO-TIX); Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards (SJACS); Residential Education; Human Resources; Athletics; all Campus Security Authorities (CSAs); and from local, state, national and international law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p>Disclosures of Clery Crimes occurring on Clery Geography made to a professional counselor or pastoral counselor in the context of a privileged (confidential) communication, are not subject to reporting requirements under this Policy. If information provided in confidential disclosures is believed to represent a serious or continuing threat to the safety of the campus community by the recipient of that confidential information, then that information may be shared with a CSA and, as a result of the CSA receiving the information, the information must be evaluated for Clery purposes.</p>
        <p>The Clery Act requires reporting of crimes in the following categories:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Criminal Offenses:
          <ul>
           <li>Criminal Homicide
            <ol>
             <li>Murder &amp; Non-negligent manslaughter</li>
             <li>Negligent manslaughter</li>
            </ol></li>
           <li>&nbsp;Sex Offenses
            <ol>
             <li>Rape</li>
             <li>Fondling</li>
             <li>Statutory Rape</li>
             <li>Incest</li>
            </ol></li>
           <li>&nbsp;Robbery</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Aggravated Assault</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Burglary</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Motor Vehicle Theft</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Arson</li>
          </ul></li>
         <li>VAWA Offenses:
          <ul>
           <li>Domestic Violence</li>
           <li>Dating Violence</li>
           <li>Stalking</li>
          </ul></li>
         <li>In addition, USC must gather statistics for the following categories of arrests or referrals for disciplinary action if an arrest was not made:
          <ul>
           <li>Liquor Law Violations</li>
           <li>Drug Law Violations</li>
           <li>Carrying or Possessing Illegal Weapons</li>
          </ul></li>
         <li>USC must also report the following Hate Crimes by category of prejudice, including race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity and disability. Statistics are required for the offenses listed above in addition to the four additional categories listed below, if the crime committed is classified as a Hate Crime:
          <ul>
           <li>Larceny/Theft</li>
           <li>Simple Assault</li>
           <li>Intimidation</li>
           <li>Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property</li>
          </ul></li>
         <li>USC must also disclose if it has determined that any of the previously listed crimes are “Unfounded.” The Clery Act has specific guidelines for classifying a reported offense as “Unfounded,” which can only occur through the action of sworn law enforcement agencies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Issue Timely Warnings</strong></p>
        <p>USC must provide timely warnings in response to reports about Clery Crimes, occurring within a Clery Reportable Location, which represent a serious or continuing threat to members of the campus community.&nbsp; This is determined on a case-by-case basis by one (or more) USC official(s) who has been pre-identified in USC’s Policy and Procedures for Issuing a Timely Warning.&nbsp;A report does not need to include personally identifiable information in order to initiate the Timely Warning determination process.&nbsp;Because the nature of criminal threats is often not limited to a single location, timely warnings must be issued in a manner likely to reach the entire campus community. Timely warnings will not include the name of the victim [Refer to Policy and Procedures for Issuance of University Alerts.]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;As noted above, if information provided in confidential disclosures is believed to represent a serious or continuing threat to the safety of the campus community by the recipient of that confidential information, then that information may be shared with a CSA and, as a result of the CSA receiving the information, the information must be evaluated for Clery purposes</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Issue Emergency Notifications</strong></p>
        <p>USC is required to inform the campus community about a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of USC faculty, staff, employees, students, patients and visitors occurring on campus.&nbsp; Emergency events may be localized; therefore, notifications may be tailored exclusively to the segment of the campus community at risk.</p>
        <p>USC also must have emergency response and evacuation procedures in place specific to its on-campus facilities. A summary of these procedures must be disclosed in the ASFSR. Additionally, the emergency response procedures must be tested at least once, annually. [Refer to Policy and Procedures for Issuance of University Alerts.]</p>
        <p><em>Exception: Emergencies where issuing a notification would compromise efforts to assist a victim, contain the emergency, respond to the emergency, or mitigate the emergency are not subject to the emergency notification requirement.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Respond to Reports of Missing Residential Students</strong></p>
        <p>USC provides every student living in on-campus housing the opportunity and means to identify an individual to be contacted in an emergency, including whenever officials determine that a student is missing.</p>
        <p>USC shall investigate all reports of missing students and will notify and cooperate with other law enforcement agencies, as necessary, to further the investigation.&nbsp; [Refer to policy on Missing Student Notifications for Students Residing in On-Campus Housing.]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Compile, Report and Publish Fire Data</strong></p>
        <p>The Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning will produce the information to be included in the ASFSR, which is part of the combined ASFSR.&nbsp; The Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning must collect and disclose fire statistics for each on-campus student housing facility separately for the three most recent calendar years for which data are available in accordance with Higher Education Opportunity Act of 1998 (HEOA) &nbsp;regulations. Each such facility must be identified in the statistics by name and street address, regardless of whether any fires have occurred.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning will provide a description of the fire safety systems in each student housing facility that is included in the ASFSR.&nbsp; These descriptions should include mechanisms (e.g., fire extinguishers, fire doors, posted evacuation routes, etc.) or systems related to the detection, warning and control of a fire. The Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning will submit the ASFSR to the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator for inclusion in the statistics reported to the U.S. Department of Education. [Refer to ASFSR.]</p>
        <p>​​​​​​​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Maintain a Public Daily Crime Log</strong></p>
        <p>USC must maintain a daily crime log documenting the “nature, date, time and general location of each crime” reported to DPS within the last 60 days, and the disposition, if known, of the reported crimes. Incidents must be entered into the log within two business days of receiving the report. The Daily Crime Log does not include personally-identifiable information about the victim or the accused. The Daily Crime Log is available within DPS, during normal business hours, and on the DPS website [<a href="https://dps.usc.edu/alerts/log/">Daily Crime Log</a>].&nbsp; Requests for public inspection of daily crime log entries beyond 60 days must be made in writing to the Records Manager within DPS and will be made available to the requestor within two business days of the request.</p>
        <p>​​​​​​​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ensure Victim Rights, Options, and Resources</strong></p>
        <p>Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking have specific rights, options, and resources required by the Clery Act.&nbsp; Individuals accused of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking also have specific rights required by the Clery Act.</p>
        <p>USC must provide victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking a written explanation of their rights. These rights include supportive measures, like the option for a relocation/change of housing, transportation, or academic course assignment. They also include access to counseling services, legal services, and assistance with making a report to law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All disciplinary proceedings must be conducted by individuals who are trained annually on the issues related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking and how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of victims and promotes accountability. Disciplinary proceedings are required to be prompt, fair, and impartial, and must confer certain procedural rights to both the accuser and the accused, including the right to an advisor of choice, equal and timely access to information that will be used in any disciplinary meeting or proceeding, and simultaneous written notification of the finding and sanction (and the rationale for each).&nbsp; These rights are incorporated into the Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation, and accompanying Resolution Processes<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>​​​​​​​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Prevention and Awareness Programs</strong></p>
        <p>USC is required to develop education, primary prevention and awareness programs for all incoming students and new employees, and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns for students and faculty.These programs must include definitions of prohibited conduct, safe and positive options for bystander intervention, information on risk reduction to recognize the warning signs of abuse behavior and how to avoid potential attacks, possible sanctions and protective measures, procedures for reporting to campus or external law enforcement authorities, and procedures for disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>​​​​​​​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;11.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Maintain a Public Daily Fire Log</strong></p>
        <p>USC maintains a daily fire log in conjunction with the daily crime log documenting the nature of the fire, date the fire occurred, date and time the fire was reported and general location of each fire-related incident in an on-campus student housing facility reported to any USC official.&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidents must be entered into the log within two business days of receiving the report and the previous 60 days of fire log entries must be available for public inspection during normal business hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for public inspection of daily fire log entries beyond 60 days must be made in writing to the Records Manager within DPS and will be made available to the requestor within two business days of the request.</p>
