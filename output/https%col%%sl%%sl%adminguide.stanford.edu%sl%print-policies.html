Purpose</strong><br> In that spirit, this Code is a shared statement of our commitment to upholding the ethical, professional and legal standards we use as the basis for our daily and long-term decisions and actions. We all must be aware of and comply with the relevant policies, standards, laws and regulations that guide our work. We are each individually accountable for our own actions and, as members of the University Community, are collectively accountable for upholding these standards of behavior and for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies.</p>

                   <p>Stanford recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Stanford must strive at all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.</p> 
                   <p>There are times when Stanford's business activities and other conduct of its University Community members are not governed by specific laws or regulations. In these instances, rules of fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others will govern our conduct at all times.</p> 
                   <p>In addition, each individual is required to conduct University business transactions with the utmost honesty, accuracy and fairness. Each situation needs to be examined in accordance with this standard. No unethical practice can be tolerated, even if such practice is "customary" outside of Stanford or even if some of the goals it serves are worthy. Expediency should never compromise integrity.</p>

                   <p>Members of the Stanford University Community must transact University business in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and University policy and procedure. Managers and supervisors are responsible for teaching and monitoring compliance. When questions arise pertaining to interpretation or applicability of policy, contact the individual who has oversight of the policy. Refer all unresolved questions and/or interpretation of laws and regulations to the Office of the General Counsel. University-wide policy documents can be found at <a href="http://policy.stanford.edu" target="_blank">policy.stanford.edu</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Contractual, Grant and Other Obligations</strong><br> The acceptance of an agreement, including sponsored project funding, may create a legal obligation on the part of Stanford University to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have authority delegated by an appropriate University official may enter into agreements on behalf of the University.

                   <p><strong>c. Non-University Professional Standards</strong><br> Some professions and disciplines represented at the University are governed by standards and codes specific to their profession (such as attorneys, certified public accountants, and medical doctors). Those professional standards generally advance the quality of the profession and/or discipline by developing codes of ethics, conduct, and professional responsibility and standards to guide their members. Those belonging to such organizations are expected to adhere to University policies and codes of conduct in addition to any professional standards. If a University Community member believes there is a conflict between a professional standard and University policy, he/she should contact the Office of the General Counsel.</p>

                   <p>A conflict of commitment can arise when a person’s external activities, e.g., consulting agreements, speaking engagements, public service, personal business, etc. interfere with the person’s responsibilities to the university.

                   <p>Outside professional activities, private financial interests or the receipt of benefits or gifts from third parties can cause an actual or perceived conflict of interest.</p> 
                   <p>Relationships between Stanford and its vendors or sponsors must be free of any real or perceived impropriety or favoritism.

                   <p>Adherence to this Code also requires that any suspected violations of applicable standards, policies, laws or regulations be brought to the attention of the appropriate cognizant office. Raising such concerns is a service to the University and does not jeopardize the University Community member’s position or employment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Reporting to Management</strong><br> Members of the University Community should report suspected violations of applicable laws, regulations, government contract and grant requirements or this Code and University policies and procedures. This reporting should normally be made initially through standard management channels, beginning with the immediate supervisor, instructor or advisor. If for any reason it is not appropriate to report suspected violations to the immediate supervisor (e.g., the suspected violation is by the supervisor), or the employee is uncomfortable doing so, individuals may go to a higher level of management within their school or department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Other Reporting</strong></p>

                   <p>Every concern is treated seriously and reviewed in the appropriate manner.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Confidentiality</strong><br> Concerns may be reported confidentially, and even anonymously, although the more information given, the easier it is to investigate the concerns. The only anonymous reporting mechanism at the University is the Compliance and Ethics Helpline web form: <a href="http://helpline.stanford.edu" target="_blank">helpline.stanford.edu</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Cooperation</strong><br> All members of the University Community are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation of potential violations of University policy and applicable rules, laws, or regulations.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Non-Retaliation</strong></p> 
                   <p>Stanford policy prohibits retaliation against an individual who in good faith reports or provides information about concerns or suspected violations. Retaliation is an adverse action taken because an individual has made a report or has participated in an investigation. An adverse action is any action that materially affects that individual's standing or terms and conditions of employment. False accusations made with the intent of harming or retaliating against another person may subject the accuser to disciplinary action.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Consequences of Violation</strong></p> 
                   <p>Confirmed violations will result in appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the University. In some circumstances, civil or criminal charges and penalties may apply.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Stanford University prohibits retaliation against an individual who in good faith submits a complaint, a report, an inquiry, or provides information about concerns or suspected violations of University policies or local, State, or Federal laws and regulations.</p> 
                   <p>Retaliation is any adverse action taken in response to an individual’s good-faith report or participation in a proceeding related to this policy that materially affects the individual's standing or terms and conditions of employment. Retaliation can be direct such as changing an individual’s work location, work assignments, pay or schedule, or it can be indirect such as intimidating, threatening, or harassing an individual who has raised a claim or participated as a witness in an investigation.</p> 
                   <p>Individuals who take retaliatory actions will be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. False accusations made with the intent of harming or retaliating against another person may subject the accuser to disciplinary action.&nbsp;</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Founding Grant</strong><br> The Leland Stanford Junior University was founded by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford on November 11, 1885, in memory of their only child. The founding of the University was accomplished by a Grant of Endowment after Senator Stanford had procured passage on March 9, 1885, of an enabling act by the legislature of the State of California. The Founding Grant conveyed to trustees certain properties, directed that a university be established, and outlined the objectives and government of the university.<br> <br> <strong>b. Amendments</strong><br> The Founding Grant reserved to the Founders the right to amend the Grant. In the years following the death of Senator Stanford in 1893, Mrs. Stanford made several amendments in the form of addresses to the Board of Trustees on such points as the nonsectarian, nonpartisan nature of the University, the powers of the President, duties of the Trustees, financial management, housing on campus, gifts from others than the Founders, summer schools, research, and tuition.<br> <br> <strong>c. Legislation and Court Decrees</strong><br> The University operated under the Founding Grant without complications until Senator Stanford's death. However, some problems became apparent in connection with the transfer of the trust money to the Trustees, the taxation of property and revenue, and the legal status of the University. Provisions were presented to and approved by the California legislature to correct defects, and the Trustees were authorized to petition the courts for judicial decrees in matters concerning the legal status of the University and the role of the Trustees.<br> <br> <strong>d. Information About the Founding</strong><br> Detailed accounts of the steps taken in the founding of Stanford University, the texts of the various legal documents, and the history of the University are in the University Archives in the Green Library. The University also publishes a booklet, <em>The Founding Grant with Amendments, Legislation, and Court Decrees</em>, and a listing of some general works of history can be found in the bibliography of the Faculty Handbook</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Powers and Duties</strong><br> The Board of Trustees is custodian of the endowment and all the properties of the University. The Board administers the invested fund, sets the annual budget, and determines policies for operation and control of the University. The powers and duties of the Board of Trustees derive from <em>The Founding Grant, Amendments, Legislation, and Court Decrees</em>. In addition, the Board operates under its own bylaws and a series of resolutions of major policy.<br> <br> <strong>b. Membership</strong><br> Board membership is set at a maximum of 38 including the President of the University, who serves ex officio and with vote. Eight of the Trustees are elected or appointed in accordance with the Rules Governing the Election or Appointment of Alumni Nominated Trustees. All members of the Board serve five-year terms and, in general, are eligible to serve two such consecutive terms (except alumni nominated trustees, who serve one five-year term only).<br> <br> <strong>c. Officers of the Board</strong><br> The Officers of the Board are the chair, one or more vice chairs, the secretary, and the associate secretary. Officers are elected to one-year terms, with the exception of the Chair, who serves a two-year term. Their terms of office begin July 1.<br> <br> <strong>d. Committees</strong><br> The six standing committees of the Board are the Committee on Audit, Compliance and Risk; the Committee on Development; the Committee on Finance; the Committee on Land and Buildings; the Committee on Student, Alumni and External Affairs; and the Committee on Trusteeship. Standing committees meet prior to each regular Board meeting unless otherwise directed by the Chair.<br> <br> <strong>e. Meetings</strong><br> The Board generally meets five times each year, in October, December, February, April and June. Meetings are normally on the second Tuesday of the month.</p>

In accordance with the by-laws of the Board of Trustees, the President of the University shall be appointed or removed only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Powers and Duties</strong><br> The by-laws and resolutions of the Board of Trustees set forth the following duties of the President of the University in addition to those he derives from the Founding Grant or by office:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>"He shall be responsible for the management of the University and all its departments, including the operation of the physical plant and the administration of the University's business activities."</li>

Absence or Inability to Act</strong><br> In the absence or inability to act of the President, the Provost shall be Acting President and shall perform the duties of the President of the University. If both the President and the Provost are unable to act or otherwise believe the circumstances warrant, the President (or Provost when functioning as President) may designate one or more persons to act on the President's behalf. In emergencies, the Chair of the Board of Trustees may designate one or more persons to act on the President's behalf or as Acting President and, if the tenure exceeds 30 days, such designation must be confirmed by the Board.</p>

                    <p>From time to time, the University enters into agreements with various independent entities that may result in an ongoing business or academic relationship with the University. For example, entities with current relationships include Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford Bookstore, Inc., and Stanford Federal Credit Union.</p>
                    <p>Although these types of entities remain independent from the University, nonetheless, the nature of the relationships makes it desirable to outline how the relationships might be structured. This Guide Memo also provides guidance to University officers, faculty and staff concerning issues that might arise and that need to be addressed <em>prior </em>to entering into such third party agreements.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Potential Issues</strong><br> The agreement between the University and the other entity should make adequate provision for issues that may be called into play by the nature of the proposed relationship. Such issues might include the following:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Potential property tax or unrelated business income tax imposed on the University</li> 
                    <li>Failure to appropriately file for a property tax exemption associated with leases of on-campus or off-campus space</li> 
                    <li>Government contract and similar allocation issues</li> 
                    <li>Vicarious liability to the University and indemnities</li> 
                    <li>Issues relating to public image or government scrutiny</li> 
                    <li>Effects on legal compliance of University benefit plans</li> 
                    <li>All aspects of land use and landowner issues regarding environmental matters</li> 
                    <li>The potential for liens or claims against Stanford property or assets</li> 
                    <li>Fraud and abuse issues in the medical area</li> 
                    <li>Employment law issues</li> 
                    <li>Private inurement or private use where University assets, income or facilities may be used in a way that benefits or results in profits to private individuals or entities</li> 
                    <li>Utilities issues</li> 
                    <li>Conflicts of interest</li> 
                    <li>The potential triggering of other statutes or governmental regulations</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>b. Definition of Relationship</strong><br> The agreement should provide a clear definition of the nature of the relationship and of any responsibilities or obligations undertaken by the parties. The agreement should also address appropriate limitations on those responsibilities or obligations in both time and scope; the defense and indemnification of the University in the event of suit or other adverse action; the need for the University to be named as an additional insured on policies of insurance; the right of the University to review financial records of the entity, where appropriate in light of the relationship; and a date for termination or reevaluation of the agreement and relationship.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Form of Agreement</strong><br> A detailed contract will not always be necessary; often a well-drafted business letter agreement may suffice. Whatever form the agreement takes, the other parties need to understand that the University does not seek to intrude inappropriately into the internal affairs of the other parties and in no way is taking on responsibility for their actions—except as to specified actions (if any) for specific reasons that are relevant to the relationship and are clearly delineated in the agreement.</p> 
                   <p>Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Real Estate department&nbsp; must receive a copy of any lease agreement made with third parties, for consideration of property tax or property tax exemption issues.</p>

Guidance on Legal or Liability Issues</strong><br> As a general proposition, if the arrangement presents novel legal issues, or if the Stanford entities involved in the relationship would like general legal guidance, the Office of the General Counsel should also be consulted. Similarly, the Risk Management Department should be consulted on proposed relationships that raise risk or liability concerns, or whenever Stanford personnel expect their activities (whether on-site or off-site) to be covered by the University's policies of insurance and self-insurance.</p>

                    <p>Stanford University&nbsp;supports the expression and discussion of ideas and opinions and encourages members of the University community to be informed and engaged citizens. At the same time, however, Stanford<span>&nbsp;is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding political activities, such as campaign activities, lobbying, and the giving of gifts to public officials.&nbsp;</span>This results in part because of the University’s status as a non-profit 501(c)(3) entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>While all members of the University community may express their political opinions and engage in political activities, it is very important that they do so only in their individual capacities and avoid even the appearance that they are speaking or acting for the University in political matters.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Campaign Activities</strong><br> Contributions of money, goods, or services to candidates for political office<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">, political parties or political action committees,&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">and in support of or opposition to ballot measure campaigns are subject to a wide variety of political laws. Depending on the jurisdiction and the campaign, political contributions may be prohibited or limited and, in nearly all cases, are subject to a complicated series of disclosure rules. Because of the University's tax-exempt status, the University is legally prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates for political office or making any contribution of money, goods, or services to candidates,&nbsp;</span>political parties or political action committees<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. It is important, therefore, that no person cause the University to make such a contribution.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Lobbying</strong><br> Lobbying can generally be described as any attempt to influence the action of any legislative body (e.g., Congress, state legislatures, county boards, city councils and their staffs) or any federal, state, or local government agency. Laws regulating lobbying exist at the federal, state, and local levels and can differ widely in scope, depending on the jurisdiction. Some laws, for example, only regulate lobbying of the legislative branch. Others, however, also cover lobbying of administrative agencies and officers in the executive branch (e.g., lobbying for federally-funded grants). To one degree or another, however, most lobbying laws require registration and reporting by individuals engaged in attempts to influence governmental action.</p> 
                   <p>Tax-exempt organizations are permitted to lobby, and the University engages in lobbying on a limited number of issues, mostly those affecting education, research, and related activities. There is usually some threshold of time or money spent on lobbying that triggers registration and reporting requirements. Regardless of thresholds, however, no University employee—other than the following individuals, on matters under their jurisdiction—may lobby on behalf of the University without specific authorization:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>President</li> 
                    <li>Provost</li> 
                    <li>Deans of the Seven Schools</li> 
                    <li>Vice Provost and Dean of Research</li> 
                    <li>Vice Provost for Graduate Education</li> 
                    <li>Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer</li> 
                    <li>Vice President of Human Resources</li> 
                    <li>Vice President for Land, Buildings and Real Estate</li> 
                    <li>Director of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</li> 
                    <li>Director of the Hoover Institution</li> 
                    <li>General Counsel</li> 
                    <li>Vice President for External Relations</li> 
                    <li>Vice President for Government Affairs</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The Vice Provost and Dean of Research may grant permission to faculty members to lobby on behalf of the University for specific purposes. The Vice President for Government Affairs&nbsp;may grant permission to staff members to lobby on behalf of the University for specific purposes. All lobbying on behalf of the University should be coordinated with the Vice President for Government Affairs. Please see the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/federal-lobbying-guidelines-stanford-faculty-and-staff" target="_blank">Federal Lobbying Guidelines for Stanford Faculty and Staff </a>in the Research Policy Handbook.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Giving of Gifts to Public Officials and Staff</strong><br> Almost all jurisdictions have strict rules on the extent to which gifts and honoraria may be given to public officials (both elected and non-elected officials and, often, staff). In some cases gifts and honoraria are prohibited; in others they are limited; and in most cases they are subject to detailed disclosure. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as California, gifts to both state and local public officials can result in a public official's disqualification from participation in any governmental action affecting the interests of the donor. Meals, travel, and entertainment are the most common types of gifts, but gift rules can also apply in cases where public officials attend a reception or receive tickets to sporting or other events.</p> 
                   <p>As a non-profit organization, the University generally does not give gifts to public officials and, in those limited cases where it does give such gifts, it must do so in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, any University employee who, on behalf of the University, wishes to make a gift to a public official must receive prior approval from the Vice President for Government Affairs&nbsp;before making such a gift.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Reporting of Political Activities</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The University must report most of its political activities above certain thresholds. Therefore, any University employee engaging in such activities on behalf of the University should carefully review the remainder of this Guide Memo and should discuss the relevant activities in advance with the&nbsp;</span>Vice President for Government Affairs<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">.</span></p>

                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) </strong>No person may, on behalf of the University, engage in any political campaign activity in support of or opposition to any candidate for elective public office (including giving or receiving funds or endorsements),&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">political party or political action committee,&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">nor shall any University resources be used for such purpose.</span></p>

Any lobbying activity, even when authorized, must be conducted in compliance with this Guide Memo, other applicable University policies, and applicable law.&nbsp;University resources include, but are not limited to, Interdepartmental Mail, equipment, personnel, supplies, computer resources, and email lists.&nbsp;See, e.g., </span><a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-6/subchapter-2/policy-6-2-1" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Administrative Guide Memo 6.2.1</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(2)(c)(4), Computer and Network Usage Policy.</span></p>

                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(4) </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">No person supporting or opposing candidates for public office, political parties or political action or engaging in other political campaign activities may use University space or facilities or receive University support, except in the limited ways described in section 3.a.</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>(5)</strong> No person may use for lobbying activities federally-funded contract or grant money received by&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">the University.</span></p> 
                   <p>Even the foregoing activities that are only restricted, rather than prohibited, may be subject to limitations imposed by law. Therefore, any person engaging in the activity, or contemplating doing so, should consult with the Vice President for Government Affairs (who will consult with the General Counsel's Office). SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory may have additional restrictions related to political activity; for guidance specific to SLAC, contact SLAC's Communication Department.</p> 
                   <p><b style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">b. Guidelines for Avoiding Prohibited Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities</b><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The following guidelines should assist in preventing the involvement or apparent involvement of the University in political activities, such as in support of or opposition to any candidate for elective public office (including both partisan and non-partisan elections). Except in the limited circumstances set forth in section 3.b., below:</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(1) Use of Name and Seal</b><br> Neither the name nor seal of the University or of any of its schools, departments, or institutions should be used on letters or other materials intended to influence such political elections.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(2) Use of Address and Telephones</b><br> No University office should be used as a return mailing address for such political mailings, and telephone service that is paid by the University, likewise, should not be used for such political purposes. (A student's dormitory room and telephone service that are personal to the student may be used for these purposes.)</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(3) Use of Title</b><br> The University title of a faculty or staff member or other person should be used only for identification and should be accompanied by a statement that the person is speaking as an individual and not as a representative of the University.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(4) Use of Services, Resources and Equipment</b><br> University services (such as Interdepartmental Mail), equipment and other resources (such as copy machines, computers and computer resources, email lists, and telephones) and supplies should not be used for such political purposes.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(5) Use of Personnel</b><br> No University employee may, as part of his or her job, be asked to perform tasks in any way related to prohibited political purposes.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. In General</strong><br> As noted above, the federal, state, and local laws which limit the political activities that can take place in University facilities and with University support in no way inhibit the expression of personal political views by any individual in the University community. Nor do they forbid faculty, students, or staff from joining others in support of candidates for office or in furtherance of political causes,&nbsp;including political activities that are permitted in this Guide<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. There is no restriction on discussion of political issues or teaching of political techniques. Academic endeavors which address public policy issues are in no way prohibited or constrained.&nbsp;</span>See, e.g., the <a href="https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy" target="_blank">Office of Special Events and Protocol</a>&nbsp;Political Activities Policy and the <a href="https://ose.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities" target="_blank">Office of Student Engagement</a> Political Activities Policy.</p> 
                   <p>Because the University encourages freedom of expression, there is an array of political activities which do not reasonably imply University involvement or identification that may be undertaken so long as University procedures are followed for use of facilities. Examples of permissible activities are:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) </strong>Use of areas, such as <a href="https://ose.stanford.edu/events/plan-event/book-space" target="_blank">White Plaza</a>,&nbsp;by registered Stanford student organizations, University schools, institutes, and recognized departments&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">for tables, speeches, and other permissible activities--subject to approval by the <a href="https://ose.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities" target="_blank">Office of Student Engagement</a>&nbsp;</span>(for student activities) or the <a href="https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy" target="_blank">Office of Special Events and Protocol</a> (for school, department or institute activities)<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">.</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> Use of auditoriums or outdoor spaces for speeches by political candidates who are speaking in a non-candidate capacity and subject to rules of the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Election Commission, and the California Fair Political Practices Commission, and other applicable laws and University policies.&nbsp;These events must be organized by registered Stanford student organizations or University schools, institutes, and recognized departments.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Arrangements must be made with&nbsp;</span>the Office of Special Events and Protocol or the Office of Student Engagement, in consultation with the Office of Government Affairs, and are subject to policies that have been established by those offices for non-candidate capacity appearances (including no signage or distribution of campaign materials, no solicitation of votes or donations, etc.). See, e.g., <a href="https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy">https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy</a> and &nbsp;<a href="https://ose.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities">https://ose.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities</a>. These policies also apply to all virtual events, webinars and symposia using varied software technologies<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. See also the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">University Events policy and the <a href="https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/university-events-policy-and-stanford-event-organizer" target="_blank">Stanford Event Organizer</a> for more information.</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Non-Stanford entities are prohibited from inviting media to the Stanford University campus for any events. Stanford schools, institutes, recognized departments, and registered student organizations interested in press/media participation must work with University Communications and the Office of Government Affairs and adhere to university press/media policies. The University will have sole responsibility for deciding whether the press/media will be invited to the event and will handle any such invitations.</p> 
                   <p>To reiterate, because tax and political compliance laws impose restrictions, or prohibitions, on certain political activities and on the use of buildings and equipment at a non-profit institution such as the University, any such activities must be in compliance with these legal requirements.&nbsp;Similarly, any activities must comply with local, county, state and federal and University guidelines regarding health and safety requirements, such as with regard to COVID-19.</p> 
                   <p>Individuals taking political positions for themselves or groups with which they are associated, but not as representatives of the University, should clearly state, by words&nbsp;(such as an express disclaimer)&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">and actions, that their positions are not those of the University and are not being taken in an official capacity on behalf of the University.&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Limited University Political Activities</strong><br> Limited activities relating to specific federal, state, or local legislation or ballot initiatives are permissible where (1) the subject matter is directly related to core interests of the University's activities; (2) the President has determined that the University should take a position; and (3) the individuals who speak or write on the University's behalf are specifically authorized to do so.</p>

                   <p>Because it may be in the interest of the University to grant exceptions to the rules in Section 2, the following procedure has been established:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Disclosure</strong><br> Whenever a staff member anticipates a situation where he/she may be potentially in violation of the policies in Section 2, that staff member must immediately make full disclosure in writing of the details of the situation, through his/her supervisor, to the cognizant University officer and request an exception. Exceptions must be approved in writing in advance. If a staff member finds that he/she has engaged in conduct that violates the policies in Section 2, such situation must be reported immediately to the cognizant University officer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Responsibility of University Officers</strong><br> Any requests for exception shall be reviewed and all facts thoroughly examined for apparent conflicts. Exceptions may be granted at the sole discretion of the University. If the cognizant University officer determines that the University would best be served by the granting of the requested exception, he/she may do so in writing with justification for the granting and delineating any conditions placed on the approval. Except in rare instances, University officers may not delegate this responsibility and any delegation must be in writing. If the designee grants an exception, the designee must provide the University officer with a memorandum detailing the circumstances of the exception.</p> 
                   <p>Copies of the approval must be retained throughout the period of employment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Annual Reports</strong><br> University officers who receive and grant exceptions to the policies in this Guide Memo shall, at the end of each academic year, provide a detailed summary report to the Provost.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Other Reports</strong><br> In addition to Section 3.c, cognizant University officers may establish, within their areas of responsibility, mandatory periodic conformance and compliance reporting procedures for all staff.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Consequences</strong><br> Failure to adhere to any aspect of the policy and procedures shall subject the involved employee(s) to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>

                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Stanford's resources exist to support the University's missions of creation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge. The University's assets must be preserved for these purposes, not for the personal gain of individuals nor for outside parties' uses which do not further Stanford's academic objectives. The University receives frequent requests for access to its resources by outside entities, typically in exchange for some form of compensation to Stanford. Many of these, if granted, would constitute unrelated business activities. The purpose of this statement is to remind the University community that it is Stanford policy not to engage in unrelated business activities.</span></p> 
                   <p>Unrelated business activities have the potential for distorting the University's primary teaching and research missions. Furthermore, revenues from such activities generally are taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus carry consequences to the University in terms of income tax liability. They also can have implications for property tax as well as product liability, and they can create unfair competition with the for-profit sector.</p> 
                   <p>Permission to engage in unrelated business activities at Stanford may be granted only by the Provost, and then only in those cases in which there is strong likelihood that the activity will significantly benefit the University as a whole.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Generation of Revenue</strong><br> For the purpose of this statement, "unrelated business activities" are activities that use Stanford resources to generate revenue from third parties, and that are unrelated in a programmatic sense to the teaching, research, and other educational functions of the University. An unrelated activity normally would not be thought to further the University's teaching or research activities, except for the revenue it produces. Because the Internal Revenue Code does not define with precision what activities are unrelated for tax purposes, a general rule of thumb to apply is to assume that any activity undertaken primarily for the revenue it produces is likely to be unrelated.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Support of Mission</strong><br> However, there are certain activities which might at first appear to be unrelated, but which, under scrutiny, are in fact related in a programmatic sense or provide direct support to Stanford's academic missions. For example, certain services or programs may be conducted on campus for the convenience of University faculty, staff and students, such as food sales at Tresidder.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Need for Review</strong><br> Because of the necessarily imprecise definition of "unrelated," activities that would generate income and are proposed to be undertaken on behalf of an outside party that involve the use of University lands, buildings or instrumentation or the rendering of services by University personnel must be reviewed in the context of the unit's programmatic mission, Internal Revenue regulations and prior case rulings before they may be approved. Examples include fabrication by University machine shops, testing or analysis of materials, use of University computer facilities and similar activities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Responsibility</strong><br> The responsibility for implementing this policy rests with line management. If a department chair, director, or dean has any question as to whether a proposed arrangement under his/her purview might constitute an unrelated business activity, it is his/her responsibility to have the activity reviewed by the cognizant vice president's office, who in turn may need to seek counsel from the Controller's Office—University Tax Director. Questions arising from departments or schools reporting to the Provost should be directed to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Exceptions</strong><br> If the cognizant vice president endorses a request for an arrangement that is determined to be an unrelated business activity, the proposal should be forwarded to the Controller's Office for a review of the potential tax consequences, and means of accommodating them, before the request is sent to the Provost for approval.</p>

Stanford’s seal and other emblems may not be used.<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>The Trademark Licensing Office (<a href="mailto:trademarks@stanford.edu">trademarks@stanford.edu</a>) is to be consulted before using Stanford’s Marks on any product, in a book title, in the name of any non-Stanford business or activity, or in the name of a course or program that is not owned by Stanford.<br> &nbsp;</li>

This prohibition includes granting permission to (a) vendors and others in a business relationship with Stanford, (b) research sponsors, (c) donors, and (d) industrial affiliate program members.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>All use of Stanford’s Marks in film, video, print and digital media (including in press releases) must comply with this Administrative Guide, as well as the policies established by University Communications (<a href="mailto:brandmanager@stanford.edu">brandmanager@stanford.edu</a>).<br> &nbsp;</li>

In these instances, Stanford's Marks may be used in accordance with the review processes established by schools, departments, centers and programs so long as the uses approved are consistent with the policies included in this Administrative Guide.<br> &nbsp;</li>

                      <li>Students and alumni may use Stanford’s name, but no other Marks, to identify their attendance at and degrees from Stanford on resumes and on digital channels such as personal web sites and social media.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>Undergraduate and graduate students may use Stanford’s name and the Block S with tree emblem on business cards which identify their student status. The approved business card format is included in the <a href="https://identity.stanford.edu/print/stationery/" target="_blank"><u>Identity Toolkit</u></a>. Alumni may not use Stanford Marks on business cards.<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>Students and alumni may use Stanford’s Marks in connection with the University-sanctioned activities of student and alumni groups that have received and maintain official ASSU or Stanford Alumni Association recognition, respectively. When the Marks are used in these instances, it must be clear that the activity is either a student activity or an alumni activity, and not a University activity.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>Only recognized student and alumni groups may produce merchandise that incorporates Stanford Marks.

                      <li>All uses of Stanford’s Marks must carry proper trademark designations, as established by the Office of the General Counsel and specified on the Trademark Licensing website. This includes ® on registered marks and TM on unregistered Marks when required.<br> &nbsp;</li> 
                      <li>Stanford’s Marks may never be altered or combined with another organization’s name or logo without permission from Stanford’s President, Provost or other individual with delegated authority under Section 2, above.</li>

                   <p><strong>a. General Policy</strong><br> Stanford should limit the collection, use, disclosure or storage of Information to that which reasonably serves the University's academic, research, or administrative functions, or other legally required purposes. Such collection, use, disclosure and storage should comply with applicable Federal and state laws and regulations, and University policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Legal and University Process</strong><br> Notwithstanding the General Policy contained in section 2.a, the University may disclose Information in the course of investigations and lawsuits, in response to subpoenas, for the proper functioning of the University, to protect the safety and well-being of individuals or the community, and as permitted by law.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Policies That Apply to Special Categories of Information</strong><br> Stanford has adopted policies governing certain categories of Information. These policies are listed in this section, 2.c. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Administrative Guide Memo 16.1 and any of these special policies, the special policy will control. For more information about Stanford's compliance with any of the laws and policies referenced below, please contact the University Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@stanford.edu">privacyofficer@stanford.edu</a> or the individual listed in section 4.b as responsible for compliance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Prohibited Information, including Social Security Number ("SSN") and Drivers License Number ("DLN")</strong><br> Stanford should not use an individual's SSN or DLN as a personal identifier unless required by law or approved by Stanford's Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer or the Data Governance Board. Prohibited information, including SSNs and DLNs, may be stored electronically only in compliance with the Guidelines. If Prohibited Information must be stored on paper, the files must be stored securely with access provided only to authorized persons.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Student Records</strong><br> Students have rights with respect to access to their education records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ("FERPA"). These rights are outlined in the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/">Stanford Bulletin</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Health Information</strong><br> Individuals have rights with respect to the privacy and security of their health information under Federal and state laws and regulations, including the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA")</a>. These rights are outlined in <a href="/1-6-2">Guide Memo 1.6.2</a> and in the University health information privacy policies that can be found at the <a href="https://privacy.stanford.edu/policies/hipaa-privacy-policies">HIPAA website</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Human Subjects Research Information</strong><br> In addition to the rights afforded by HIPAA and other laws related to health information, the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/index.html">Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects ("Common Rule")</a> outlines provisions specific to the privacy of research participants and the confidentiality of their information. The Stanford Research Compliance Office maintains the <a href="http://humansubjects.stanford.edu/new/policies_regulations/index.html">Human Research Protection Program ("HRPP")</a> that includes the University policies related specifically to human subjects' research information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(5) Financial Services Records</strong><br> The <a href="http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA")</a> requires that Stanford protect the privacy and security of information collected in the course of providing certain financial services, such as student financial aid or faculty staff housing loans. Stanford has adopted polices to protect this information. These policies are located on the <a href="https://ogc.stanford.edu">Office of General Counsel's website</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(6) Information Collected in the Course of Electronic Commerce</strong><br> Some areas of the Stanford website operate commercial enterprises online. Stanford also delivers online service through its network. To comply with the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;division=8.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=22.&amp;article=">California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003</a> when Stanford (or any of its partners) collects personally identifiable consumer information on one of the commercial areas of its website or as the operator of an online service, it will conspicuously post either a privacy policy or a link to a privacy policy on the portal page for the commercial activity. This policy will:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(a)</strong> Identify the categories of personally identifiable information collected through the commercial portions of its website or through its online service;<br> <strong>(b)</strong> Identify the categories of third-parties with whom Stanford may share that personally identifiable information;<br> <strong>(c)</strong> Provide a description of how an individual may request changes to their personally identifiable information collected through the Web site or online service and retained by Stanford, if any process exists;<br> <strong>(d)</strong> Describe the process by which Stanford will notify users of the commercial portion of Stanford's website or its online service of material changes to the Stanford's privacy policy for that portion of the website or online service (it is sufficient to say that the policy will be updated online); and<br> <strong>(e)</strong> Identify the effective date of the privacy policy and all updates.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Confidentiality Agreement</strong><br> Members of the Stanford community are subject to the Confidentiality and Privacy provisions set forth in Section 3 of the Code of Conduct contained in Administrative Guide Memo 1. As a reminder of Stanford's commitment to privacy, students, faculty, staff and other members of the workforce may be asked to sign a confidentiality statement based on the Code of Conduct and this privacy policy. Failure to sign such a statement in no way diminishes the obligation to uphold Stanford's policies.</p>

                   <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p> 
                   <p>Stanford University is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and University policies. The University endeavors to provide a strong infrastructure that promotes a culture committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information. These guidelines serve a dual purpose. They provide faculty, staff, trainees, students, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and other members of the Stanford community ("workforce members") notice of the consequences they will face for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act ("COMIA"), or other federal and state laws and regulations governing the confidentiality and security of patient information ("applicable laws"), or University policies relating to privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information.</p> 
                   <p>Separately, the guidelines provide University offices (e.g., privacy offices, human resources, academic and student affairs offices) and individual managers direction in determining appropriate consequences for workforce members who violate applicable laws or University policies that safeguard protected health information ("PHI") and other patient medical information. These guidelines should be used in conjunction with the corrective action or discipline policy applicable to the relevant workforce member including:</p>

                   <p><strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>A. Imposition of Appropriate Sanctions</strong><!-- br--><br> Workforce members will be sanctioned appropriately in the event that they:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) </strong>access, use or disclose more than the minimum PHI necessary to complete their job-related functions;<br> <strong>(2) </strong>fail to adequately protect PHI in accordance with Stanford University's information security policies;<br> <strong>(3)</strong> fail to promptly report a known or suspected HIPAA violation; or<br> <strong>(4)</strong> violate any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines.</p> 
                   <p>Sanctions may also be imposed for failure to report a known or suspected HIPAA violation or for violating any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines. Sanctions for violations of HIPAA may include, without limitation, counseling, written warning, suspension, and termination. A workforce member's compensation and eligibility to continue in an academic or training program may also be impacted in the event of a violation. These guidelines are not intended to dictate a particular consequence in any particular situation. Rather, in consultation with the appropriate Human Resources and/or Privacy Office, managers, academic affairs and student affairs administrators have the discretion to decide:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>(1) </strong>at which level to start the corrective action process based on the severity of the offense, the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">potential or actual harm to the patient and/or the Hospital(s) or University, and any&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">mitigating factors; and<br> <strong>(2) </strong>whether immediate termination is justified based on the seriousness of the offense.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>B. Levels of Violations</strong><!-- br--><br> The level of a violation is determined by the severity of the privacy or security breach, whether the breach was intentional or unintentional or motivated by malice or personal gain, and the impact on the patient and/or institution. The following outlines some, but not all, types of violations and categorizes them broadly according to likely severity.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Level 1: </strong>A workforce member carelessly or inadvertently accesses PHI without a job-related need to know, or carelessly or unintentionally reveals PHI to which he/she has authorized access. Examples of Level 1 violations include, but are not limited to:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> Leaving PHI in a public area in the workplace or disposing of it in the trash instead of shredding receptacles;<br> <strong>(2)</strong> Misdirecting faxes, emails or other documents that contain PHI;<br> <strong>(3) </strong>Discussing PHI in public areas where the discussion could be overheard;<br> <strong>(4)</strong> Other behaviors reflecting carelessness or lack of judgment in handling PHI.</p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Level 2:</strong> A workforce member intentionally accesses PHI without authorization or seriously fails to protect PHI. Examples of Level 2 violations include, but are not limited to:</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> Intentionally accessing or asking another to access PHI without a job-related need to know, the PHI or a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality or any other individual (including searching for the existence of a record or an address or phone number);<br> <strong>(2) </strong>Leaving paper files and records, computers, laptops, notebooks, smart phones or other devices containing PHI accessible and unattended;<br> <strong>(3)</strong> Sharing log-in IDs and passwords with others;<br> <strong>(4) </strong>Using personal email accounts (e.g., Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo), cloud computing, or other media or storage devices not approved by Stanford University for transmission or storage of PHI or not meeting required security standards (such as encryption, secure email, password protection);<br> <strong>(5)</strong> Removing PHI from the Stanford University workplace without supervisor approval or failing to appropriately safeguard PHI if removed with supervisor approval or while in transit;<br> <strong>(6)</strong> Other behaviors reflecting intentional conduct or serious failure to safeguard PHI.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Level 3: </strong>A workforce member intentionally accesses, uses or discloses PHI without authorization, often motivated by willful disregard, malice or personal gain. A Level 3 violation is considered serious misconduct. Examples of Level 3 violations include, but are not limited to:</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Prohibited Sexual Conduct is the umbrella term that Stanford uses under this Policy to collectively define different types of misconduct relating to sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, or exploitation of a sexual nature. Stanford prohibits all forms of Prohibited Sexual Conduct. Stanford is obligated to comply with both state and federal laws with respect to reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct, when applicable. It is also a violation of this Policy to engage in Retaliation or Intimidation (as those terms are defined below) or to violate a University Directive or Court Order (as those terms are defined below) related to Prohibited Sexual Conduct or allegations of Prohibited Sexual Conduct.</p> 
                   <p>Regardless of the source of the definition (state, federal, or University), it is a violation of this Policy to commit or attempt to commit any of the acts defined below or to knowingly aid or facilitate another person to commit any act of the acts defined below.</p> 
                   <h3><strong>a. Sexual Harassment</strong></h3> 
                   <p>Stanford is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are fundamental to the University, and this policy is not intended to stifle teaching methods or freedom of expression generally, nor will it be permitted to do so. However, Sexual Harassment is neither legally protected expression nor the proper exercise of academic freedom. It compromises the integrity of the University, its tradition of intellectual freedom and the trust placed in its members.</p> 
                   <h4>Title IX Sexual Harassment (applies to all community members)</h4> 
                   <p>Title IX Sexual Harassment involves conduct, on the basis of sex, that satisfies one or more of the following:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, <em>AND</em> objectively offensive that it denies a person equal educational access; <em>OR</em></li> 
                    <li>An employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the recipient on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h4>Employment-Related Sexual Harassment (applies in employment-related matters)</h4> 
                   <p>Employment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of Title IX and, therefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment, as described in Section 8, below. In addition, Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may be conduct that is part of overall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment matter. In such scenarios, the employee would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment and the University will concurrently review the matter for a violation of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment. Where conduct constitutes both Title IX Sexual Harassment and Employment-Related Sexual Harassment, the Employment-Related Sexual Harassment will not serve as a basis for additional discipline.</p> 
                   <p>Employment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct, on the basis of sex, that involves one or more of the following:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute Employment-Related Sexual Harassment when: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in a University activity; OR</li> 
                      <li>The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating or hostile work environment.</li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Determining what constitutes Employment-Related Sexual Harassment depends on the specific facts and context in which the conduct occurs. Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may take many forms; subtle and indirect or blatant and overt. For example, it may:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Be conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression, gender identity or sexual orientation;</li> 
                    <li>Occur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;</li> 
                    <li>Be aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or it may have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior or work performance; or</li> 
                    <li>Consist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently egregious.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Whether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile environment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended by the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar circumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR pervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s services, activities, or opportunities).</p> 
                   <h4>University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students</h4> 
                   <p>For all student-related matters in a non-employment matter, University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of Title IX, and therefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment. In addition, University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students may be conduct that is part of overall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment matter. In such scenarios, the student would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the University will concurrently review the matter for a violation of University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students. Where conduct violates both Title IX Sexual Harassment and University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students, the violation of University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students will not serve as a basis for additional discipline.</p> 
                   <p>University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students is conduct that involves one or more of the following:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>A student in a position of authority in a student organization conditioning the provision of membership, aid, benefit or service on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; OR</li> 
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual advances, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating or hostile academic or student living environment.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Determining what constitutes University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students depends on the specific facts and context in which the conduct occurs. University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students may take many forms: subtle and indirect or blatant and overt. For example, it may:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Be conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression, gender identity or sexual orientation;</li> 
                    <li>Occur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;</li> 
                    <li>Be aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior; or</li> 
                    <li>Consist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently egregious.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Whether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile environment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended by the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar circumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR pervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s services, activities, or opportunities).</p> 
                   <h3>b. Sexual Assault (applies to all community members)</h3> 
                   <h4>Consent</h4> 
                   <p>The following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Affirmative Consent </strong>means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that the person has the Affirmative Consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean Affirmative Consent, nor does silence mean Affirmative Consent. Affirmative Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. Affirmative Consent may be based on a condition(s), <em>e.g</em>., the use of a condom, and that condition(s) must continue to be met throughout an activity, unless there is mutual agreement to forego or change the condition. When there is no Affirmative Consent present during sexual activity, the activity at issue necessarily occurred “against the person’s will.” 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of Affirmative Consent.</li> 
                      <li>In evaluating Affirmative Consent, it cannot be a defense that a respondent’s belief that the complainant consented to the sexual activity arose under either of the following circumstances: 
                       <ul> 
                        <li>The respondent’s belief in Affirmative Consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the respondent.</li> 
                        <li>The respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant gave Affirmative Consent.</li> 
                       </ul> </li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                    <li><strong>Incapacitation:</strong>&nbsp;It shall not be a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the complainant Affirmatively Consented to sexual activity if the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was Incapacitated. Incapacitation means the complainant was unable to Affirmatively Consent because the complainant was asleep, unconscious, under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, such that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity, or was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition. Incapacitation is not necessarily the same as legal intoxication.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h4>Stranger and Nonstranger Sexual Assault</h4> 
                   <p>The following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:</p> 
                   <p>For the purposes of this Policy, a <em><strong>nonstranger</strong></em> is someone known to the Complainant, whether through a casual meeting or through a longstanding relationship, including a dating or domestic relationship. A <em><strong>stranger</strong></em> is someone unknown to the Complainant at the time of the Sexual Assault.</p> 
                   <p>California law requires universities to describe how a school will respond to instances of stranger and non-stranger Sexual Assault: Stanford applies the same policies and sanctions for both stranger and nonstranger Sexual Assault.</p> 
                   <h4>Title IX &amp; University Sexual Assault<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></h4> 
                   <p>Title IX &amp; University Sexual Assault any sexual act<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> directed against a Complainant without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent, including because of Incapacitation.</p>

                        <p>It is a violation of this Policy to Intimidate or Retaliate against any person making a complaint or responding to a complaint or against any person participating in the investigation of any such allegation under this Policy (including being the Respondent or participating as a Witness). No person may threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for pursuing or exercising any right or privilege secured by this Policy, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, responded to a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to this Policy.</p> 
                        <ul> 
                         <li><strong>Retaliation</strong> includes, but is not limited to, adverse action related to employment, academic opportunities, participation in University programs or activities, or similar punitive action. Retaliation can be direct such as changing an employee’s work location, pay or schedule, or for students, changing a grade or denying access to a program, or it can be indirect such as Intimidating, threatening, or harassing an employee or student who has raised a claim or participated as a witness in an investigation.</li> 
                         <li><strong>Intimidation</strong> can be a form of Retaliation, and includes any threatening statement or conduct made with the intent to prevent or dissuade any party or witness from reporting or participating in the process.</li>

                        <p>Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of an investigation does not constitute Retaliation, provided, however, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute Retaliation.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>If you or someone you know has experienced Prohibited Sexual Conduct, here are some immediate steps to consider:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">If the individual is in immediate danger, or believes there could be an ongoing threat to the individual or the community, please call 911 or 9-911 from a campus phone or use a blue emergency phone tower on campus.</span></li> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The individual that experienced the conduct is encouraged to contact the police, although the individual is not required to make a report to the police. For Prohibited Sexual Conduct that occurs on the Stanford campus, individuals can contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety at (650) 723-9633. For an off-campus incident, individuals can call the local police jurisdiction: Palo Alto, (650) 329-2307; Menlo Park, (650) 325-4424.&nbsp;University officials also will assist individuals in contacting local law enforcement authorities, if the individual requests assistance. If the individual believes that there is an ongoing threat to safety from a particular individual, the individual may request an emergency protective restraining order from a California police officer.</span></li> 
                    <li>California law also provides that individuals who experience sexual violence are encouraged to preserve evidence and to note the identity and location of Witnesses. Contacting law enforcement to make a report allows for forensic evidence to be collected, including a SART exam if needed, which may be helpful if a decision is made to pursue criminal charges. For more information about how to obtain a SART exam, see: <a href="https://sexualviolencesupport.stanford.edu/">https://sexualviolencesupport.stanford.edu/</a>.</li> 
                    <li>Supportive Measures are available with or without filing a complaint and regardless of whether the university has jurisdiction over an alleged incident.&nbsp;Supportive Measures will be different for every matter and will be based on individualized review. Stanford offers confidential counseling to community members, through the Confidential Support Team for students, and through the Faculty/Staff HELP Center for others. Other Supportive Measures may include extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar measures. The Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of Supportive Measures. The Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will consider the Complainant’s wishes with respect to Supportive Measures.</li>

                    <li><strong>Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE</strong></li> 
                    <li><strong>Deputy Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE</strong></li> 
                    <li><strong>Other Senior Leaders</strong> 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>President</li> 
                      <li>Provost</li> 
                      <li>Deans of Schools</li> 
                      <li>Director of Athletics (DAPER)</li> 
                      <li>Vice Presidents</li> 
                      <li>Vice Provosts</li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h4>External Reports</h4> 
                   <p>Certain Prohibited Sexual Conduct may also violate state and federal law. In addition to the internal resources just described, individuals may pursue complaints directly with the government agencies that deal with unlawful harassment and discrimination claims, e.g., the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</a>, the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html">Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/">State of California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH)</a>. Please note that a violation of this policy may exist even where the conduct in question does not violate the law.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="privacy-and-confidentiality"><span class="prefix-container">5. </span>Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>For the purpose of this Policy, Privacy and Confidentiality have distinct meanings.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> means that information related to a complaint will be shared with a limited number of University employees who “need to know” in order to assist in the assessment, investigation, and resolution of the report. All employees who are responsible for the University’s response to violations of this Policy receive specific training and guidance about sharing and safeguarding private information in accordance with state and federal law. The privacy of student education records will be protected in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), and the privacy of employee records will be protected in accordance with California law and University policy.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> exists in the context of laws that protect certain relationships, including those who provide services related to medical and clinical care, mental health providers, counselors, and ordained clergy. The law creates a privilege between certain health care providers, mental health care providers, attorneys, clergy, spouses, and others, with their patients, clients, parishioners, and spouses. The University has designated individuals who have the ability to have privileged communications as Confidential Resources.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The University will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve an individual’s Privacy and to protect the Confidentiality of information. However, because of laws relating to reporting and other state and federal laws, the University cannot guarantee Confidentiality relating to incidents of Prohibited Sexual Conduct except where those reports are privileged communications to Confidential Resources. Even then, there are exceptions to maintaining Confidentiality set by law; for example, physicians and nurses who treat any physical injury sustained during a sexual assault are required to report it to law enforcement. Also, physicians, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, teachers and social workers must report a sexual assault committed against a person under age 18.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></p> 
                   <p>Except for Confidential Resources, information shared with other individuals is not legally protected from being disclosed. However, the University takes requests for Privacy and Confidentiality seriously, to the extent it can do so while at the same time fulfilling its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students and the University community. The University in such circumstances will make sure the Complainant is aware he/she/they are protected from Retaliation.</p> 
                   <h4>Reports to Law Enforcement and Required Notifications</h4> 
                   <p>As required by the Clery Act, all disclosures to any University employee of an on-campus or “non-campus property” sexual assault must be reported for statistical purposes only (without personal identifiers) to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety, which has the responsibility for tabulating and annually publishing sexual assault and other crime statistics. To promote public safety, the Department also alerts the campus community to incidents and trends of immediate concern.</p> 
                   <p>When the allegations described could be a crime under California law,<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref1" title="">[12]</a> University staff members designated as <a href="https://police.stanford.edu/security-report.html">Campus Security Authorities</a> are also required by California law to notify the Stanford University Department of Public Safety. Under California law, violent crimes, including sexual assault, and hate crimes must be reported immediately by calling 9-1-1 or 650-329-2413. Campus security Authorities can report other crimes at <a href="https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Report-Form.pdf">https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Report-Form.pdf</a>. (For more information see: <a href="https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Flowchart.pdf">https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Flowchart.pdf</a>).</p> 
                   <p>Except in the event the person who is the subject of the potential criminal act is a minor, the name of this individual should not be released to the Department of Public Safety without the Complainant’s consent.</p> 
                   <p>In California, a police officer is required to ask a victim of sexual assault and domestic violence (specifically section 273.5 Penal Code) if they want their name to remain confidential (Penal Code 293(a)). If a victim elects to have their name remain confidential, the police will not list the victim's name in a crime log or release it to University officials without permission (Penal Code 293(d)). If the District Attorney elects to prosecute a sexual assault, the name of an adult victim may be subject to disclosure.</p> 
                   <h4>Consultation/Confidential Resources</h4> 
                   <p>The University makes available Confidential Resources for consultation regarding reports of violations of this Policy or other conduct, whether or not a Policy violation has actually occurred or the person seeking information is a Complainant, a person who believes their own actions may be the subject of criticism (even if unwarranted), or a third party. Often there is a desire that a consultation be confidential or “off the record.” This can usually be achieved when individuals discuss conduct without identifying the other persons involved, and sometimes even without identifying themselves. However,<strong> when a name or details sufficient to identify an individual are provided to a Responsible Employee (defined above), a consultation can no longer be considered “off the record” and then needs to be reported.</strong> Confidential Resources, by contrast, are not required to report to or share any information with the University. Confidential Resources do not disclose information received by them with any other office or person, including the SHARE Title IX office, and therefore meeting with a Confidential Resource will never lead to a University response or Investigation. However, Confidentiality does not extend to reasonable belief that a minor (under age 18) has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, which by law must be reported to law enforcement or child protective services. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Similarly, if a client, or a close relation of the client, makes a specific threat of planning to kill or seriously harm another person to a Confidential counselor, this also requires a report to law enforcement. In addition, the University cannot guarantee that conversations with the Ombuds or a dean at the Office for Religious Life at Memorial Church might not be subject to disclosure in legal proceedings or pursuant to other legal process. Communications with attorneys, medical doctors, and mental health care providers, on the other hand, may be privileged under law.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <h3>For Faculty, Staff and Postdoctoral Scholars</h3> 
                   <p>In compliance with California Government Code Section 12950.1, all supervisors (including faculty) who are employed by Stanford are required to participate in a minimum 2-hour sexual harassment training at least every two years. Other topics covered by this program include illegal discrimination, abusive behavior in the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active “upstander,” supervisor’s responsibility to report and how to appropriately respond to reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct within the student and staff communities.</p> 
                   <p>Further, Stanford requires non-supervisory employees to participate in a minimum 1-hour sexual harassment prevention training at least every two years. All new employees who are not faculty and who do not supervise other workers will be provided Harassment Prevention Training for Non-Supervisory Employees generally within six months of hire. Temporary and casual employees will generally be provided training within 30 calendar days of the date of hire. Participants will learn how to recognize sexual misconduct in the workplace and about campus resources. Other topics covered by this program include illegal discrimination, abusive behavior in the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active “upstander,” and how to report and appropriately respond to reports of sexual violence or harassment within the student and staff communities.</p> 
                   <p>Failure to complete assigned prevention education programming/training may result in corrective action.</p> 
                   <h3>For Students</h3> 
                   <p>Stanford requires all incoming students, graduates and undergraduates, to complete prevention education programming prior to enrolling at Stanford, generally through an assigned online course. Additionally, undergraduates are expected to participate in additional programming on campus, or virtually. The university or departments may require additional programming for students, such as student athletes, or students participating in Greek life. Failure to complete assigned prevention education programming can result in an enrollment hold.</p> 
                   <p>Student staff and student teaching assistants are required to complete additional training in order to fulfill their student staff or teaching responsibilities. Failure to complete the training can result in termination from the role.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The University has several procedures available to resolve allegations of violations of this Policy. In general, the University will investigate or otherwise respond to reports of violations of this Policy in circumstances in which either:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Both the Respondent and the Complainant are subject to this Policy and there is a connection between the allegations and University programs or activities; OR</li> 
                    <li>The Respondent is subject to this Policy and investigation and response are necessary for the proper functioning of the University, including the safety of members of the University community or preservation of a respectful and safe climate at the University.&nbsp;</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Which procedure the University will use to investigate and resolve a violation of this Policy depends on the circumstances of the report, including the respective roles of the Complainant and Respondent at the University, the location of the alleged Policy violation and relationship to University programs or activities, and the severity of the alleged conduct.&nbsp;More information about available procedures can be found at <a href="https://titleix.stanford.edu/investigationgrievance-administrative-policy-and-procedures">https://titleix.stanford.edu/investigationgrievance-administrative-policy-and-procedures</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Procedures specific to Employment-Related Sexual Harassment are as follows:</p> 
                   <h3>Procedures for Employment-Related Sexual Harassment</h3> 
                   <h4>University Intervention</h4> 
                   <p>Depending on the circumstances and taking into account a Complainant’s request for Confidentiality, a University Intervention in the workplace or academic setting may be attempted. The Intervention may be led by Human Resources professionals, Title IX staff members, the Ombuds, other faculty or staff, or sometimes an outside party unrelated to the University. An Intervention is an action to address a concern without a formal investigation. This process is appropriate when the allegation, if true, would not rise to the level of a Policy violation, but the conduct is nonetheless objectionable. Examples of this conduct could include inappropriate jokes and comments. This process is also appropriate when the Complainant does not want the University to conduct a full investigation and the University considers an intervention an appropriate step to address the concerns. The goal is to address the reported behavior to the extent possible while honoring the wishes of the Complainant.</p> 
                   <p>In addition, in the event the person who is the subject of the Policy violation decides not to submit a complaint, the University, consistent with its obligations under California and federal law, reserves the discretion to take prompt, remedial action upon the receipt of notice of a potential Policy violation to cause any harassing behavior to stop.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <h4>Investigations</h4> 
                   <p>If significant facts are contested, a prompt investigation may be undertaken. The investigation will be conducted by impartial and trained personnel in a way that respects, to the reasonable extent possible bearing in mind the safety of the campus community, the privacy of all of the persons involved. In appropriate cases, internal or external professional investigators may be asked to conduct or assist in the investigation. In making a finding, the investigator will use the “Preponderance of the Evidence” standard: is it more likely than not that the reported allegations are true. The University will strive to complete investigations as expeditiously as possible. The results of the investigation may be used in the third party intervention process or in a grievance or disciplinary action.</p> 
                   <h4>Disciplinary Procedures, Grievances and/or Appeals</h4> 
                   <p>In appropriate cases, disciplinary procedures may be initiated. The applicable disciplinary procedure depends on the status of the individual whose conduct is in question (the Respondent).</p> 
                   <p>Depending upon the nature of the remedial or corrective action imposed, the Respondent may be able to appeal or grieve the disciplinary result. The applicable appeal/grievance procedure depends on the circumstances and the position of the Respondent. Generally, the process consists of the individual's submission of a complaint, a fact-finding process or investigation by a University representative, followed by a decision and, in some cases, the possibility of one or more appeals, usually to Stanford administrative officers at higher levels.</p> 
                   <h4>Indemnification and Costs</h4> 
                   <p>The question sometimes arises as to whether the University will defend and indemnify a Stanford employee accused of sexual harassment. California law provides, in part, "An employer shall indemnify [its] employee for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct consequence of the discharge of his/her duties as such..." The issue of indemnification depends on the facts and circumstances of each situation. Individuals who violate this policy, however, should be aware that they and/or their schools, institutes, or other units may be required to pay or contribute to any judgments, costs and expenses incurred as a result of behavior that is wrongful and/or contrary to the discharge of the employee's duties. In general, see Administrative <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-4/policy-2-4-6">Guide Memo 2.4.6</a>.</p> 
                   <h4>Recordkeeping</h4> 
                   <p>The SHARE Title IX Office will track reports of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment for statistical purposes and report at least annually concerning their number, nature and disposition to the University President through the Provost. University decision-makers have a responsibility to keep the SHARE Title IX Office informed about the outcome of cases.</p> 
                   <p>The SHARE Title IX Office may keep confidential records of reports of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment and the actions taken in response to those reports and use them for purposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training so that training priorities can be established.</p> 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                   <h4>Policy Footnotes</h4> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn1" name="_ftn1"></a>[1] This Policy is also designed to comply with the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) (42 U.S.C. 13925) and its implementing regulations (24 C.F.R. 5.2001) if reauthorized.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn2" name="_ftn2"></a>[2] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that "sexual assault" for purposes of Title IX is defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), which in turn provides that "[t]he term ‘sexual assault’ means an offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." The definitions for forcible and nonforcible sex offenses are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and/or National Incident-Based Reporting System. On August 13, 2020, OCR provided guidance that a university may use definitions from either system, so long as the university includes in its definition of sexual assault all forcible and nonforcible sex offenses described by the FBI—regardless of whether the FBI system uses the label forcible or nonforcible or requires force as an element. Consistent with this guidance, Stanford has elected to use the definitions from each system that provide the most flexibility and that do not use the requirement of force as an element. Stanford has also made slight, non-substantive modifications to the FBI definitions for clarity and consistency with defined terms used within this Policy, such as "Complainant," "Affirmative Consent," and "Incapacitation."</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn3" name="_ftn3"></a>[3] The following sexual acts covered by this definition are required to be included by federal regulations and are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual definitions:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Rape</strong>. Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Sodomy</strong>. Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Sexual Assault with an Object</strong>. To use an object or instrument to penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Fondling</strong>. The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including in instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn4" name="_ftn4"></a>[4] This definition is derived from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn5" name="_ftn5"></a>[5] This definition is derived from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual. See also <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">footnote 11</a> for information regarding reporting requirements for this Policy violation.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn6" name="_ftn6"></a>[6] Note that it is possible that some instances of University Nonforcible Sexual Violations might also rise to the level of Title IX Sexual Harassment, such as secretly recording and broadly posting an individual engaged in sexual activity.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn7" name="_ftn7"></a>[7] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “dating violence” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn8" name="_ftn8"></a>[8] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “domestic violence” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn9" name="_ftn9"></a>[9] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “stalking” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn10" name="_ftn10"></a>[10] Consistent with FEHA, the University does not require a complaint of Prohibited Sexual Conduct to be in writing, but the University’s ability to respond to a complaint that is not in writing may be limited, as provided in the Title IX Procedure.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn11" name="_ftn11"></a>[11] University staff members with a duty to report are required to report instances of Statutory Rape under this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE only as consistent with California Penal Code sections 11165.1, 11165.9, and 261.5(d), which provide that sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor are only required to be reported when one person is 21 years of age or older and the other person is under 16 years of age.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn12" name="_ftn12"></a>[12] Questions about whether conduct could be a crime should be directed to the SHARE Title IX Office or Department of Public Safety.</p> 
                   <p><a id="_ftn13" name="_ftn13"></a>[13] Individuals who meet the definition of a mandated reporter under California Penal Code sections 11165.7, 11166, and 11167, must report those incidents of child abuse and neglect as directed by the applicable statute.&nbsp; A person under the age of 18 years of age is a minor subject to these provisions. In addition, physicians and nurses who treat any physical injury sustained during sexual violence are required to report such cases to law enforcement.

                   <p>There are special risks in any sexual or romantic relationship between individuals in inherently unequal positions, and parties in such a relationship assume those risks. In the university context, such positions include (but are not limited to) teacher and student, supervisor and employee, senior faculty and junior faculty, mentor and trainee, adviser and advisee, teaching assistant and student, principal investigator and postdoctoral scholar or research assistant, coach and athlete, attending physician and resident or fellow, and individuals who supervise the day-to-day student living environment and their students.</p> 
                   <p>Because of the potential for conflict of interest, exploitation, favoritism, and bias, such relationships may undermine the real or perceived integrity of the supervision and evaluation provided. Further, these relationships are often less consensual than the individual whose position confers power or authority believes. In addition, circumstances may change, and conduct that was previously welcome may become unwelcome. Even when both parties have consented at the outset to a sexual or romantic involvement, this past consent does not remove grounds for a charge based upon subsequent unwelcome conduct.</p> 
                   <p>Such relationships may also have unintended, adverse effects on the climate of an academic program or work unit, thereby impairing the learning or working environment for others – both during such a relationship and after any break-up. Relationships in which one party is in a position to evaluate the work or influence the career of the other may provide grounds for complaint by third parties when that relationship gives undue access or advantage, restricts opportunities, or simply creates a perception of these problems.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Additionally, even when a relationship ends, there may be bias (even if unintentional) for or against the former partner, or there could be an ongoing impression of such bias; in other words, the effects of a romantic or sexual relationship can extend beyond the relationship itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>For all of these reasons, sexual or romantic relationships--whether regarded as consensual or otherwise--between individuals in inherently unequal positions should in general be avoided and in many circumstances are strictly prohibited by this policy.</strong> Since these relationships can occur in multiple contexts on campus, this policy addresses certain contexts specifically. However, the policy covers all sexual and romantic relationships involving individuals in unequal positions, even if not addressed explicitly in what follows.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>At a university, the role of the teacher is multifaceted, including serving as intellectual guide, mentor, role model and advisor. This role is at the heart of the University’s educational mission and its integrity must be maintained. The teacher’s influence and authority can extend far beyond the classroom and into the future, affecting the academic progress and careers of our students.</p> 
                   <p>Accordingly, the University expects teachers to maintain interactions with students free from influences that may interfere with the learning and personal development experiences to which students are entitled. In this context, teachers include those who are entrusted by Stanford to teach, supervise, mentor and coach students, including faculty and consulting faculty of all ranks, lecturers, academic advisors, and principal investigators.&nbsp; The specific policies on teachers outlined below do not apply to Stanford students (undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral scholars) who may at times take on the role of teachers or teaching assistants, policies for whom are addressed in a separate section.</p> 
                   <p>As a general proposition, the University believes that a sexual or romantic relationship between a teacher and a student – even where consensual and whether or not the student is subject to supervision or evaluation by the teacher – is inconsistent with the proper role of the teacher.&nbsp; Not only can these relationships harm the educational environment for the individual student involved, they also undermine the educational environment for other students. Furthermore, such relationships may expose the teacher to charges of misconduct and create a potential liability, not only for the teacher, but also for the University if it is determined that laws against sexual harassment or discrimination have been violated.</p> 
                   <p>Consequently, the University has established the following parameters regarding sexual or romantic relationships with Stanford students:</p> 
                   <p><strong>First</strong>, because of the relative youth of undergraduates and their particular vulnerability in such relationships, <strong>sexual or romantic</strong> <strong>relationships between teachers and undergraduate students are</strong> <strong>prohibited</strong> – regardless of current or future academic or supervisory responsibilities for that student.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>Second</strong>, <strong>whenever a teacher has had, or in the future might reasonably be expected to have, academic responsibility over any student, such relationships are</strong> <strong>prohibited</strong>. This includes, for example, any faculty member who teaches in a graduate student’s department, program or division.&nbsp; Conversely, no teacher shall exercise academic responsibility over a student with whom he or she has previously had a sexual or romantic relationship. “Academic responsibility” includes (but is not limited to) teaching, grading, mentoring, advising on or evaluating research or other academic activity, participating in decisions regarding funding or other resources, clinical supervision, and recommending for admissions, employment, fellowships or awards.&nbsp; In this context, students include graduate and professional school students, postdoctoral scholars, and clinical residents or fellows.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Third</strong>, certain staff roles (including deans and other senior administrators, coaches, supervisors of student employees, Residence Deans and Fellows, as well as others who mentor, advise or have authority over students) also have broad influence on or authority over students and their experience at Stanford. For this reason, <strong>sexual or romantic relationships between such staff members and undergraduate students are prohibited</strong>. Similarly, relationships between staff members and other students over whom the staff member has had or is likely in the future to have such influence or authority are prohibited.</p> 
                   <p>When a preexisting sexual or romantic relationship between a university employee and a student is prohibited by this policy – or if a relationship not previously prohibited becomes prohibited due to a change in circumstances – the employee must both<strong> recuse</strong> himself or herself from any supervisory or academic responsibility over the student, and <strong>notify</strong> his or her supervisor, department chair or dean about the situation so that adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements can be put in place. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely fashion will itself be considered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.</p>

                   <p>Many existing policies govern student responsibilities towards each other.&nbsp; The current policy applies when undergraduate or graduate students or post-doctoral scholars are serving in the teaching role as teachers, TAs, graders or research supervisors. The policy does not prohibit students from having consensual sexual or romantic relationships with fellow students. However, if such a relationship exists between a student teacher and a student in a setting for which the student teacher is serving in this capacity, s/he shall not exercise any evaluative or teaching function for that student.&nbsp; <strong>Furthermore, the student teacher must recuse himself or herself and notify his or her supervisor so that alternative evaluative, oversight or teaching arrangements can be put in place.</strong>&nbsp; This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to notify and recuse in this situation will be subject to discipline under the Fundamental Standard.&nbsp; The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.</p>

                   <p>Consensual sexual or romantic relationships between adult employees (including faculty) are not in general prohibited by this policy. However, relationships between employees in which one has direct or indirect authority over the other are always potentially problematic. This includes not only relationships between supervisors and their staff, but also between senior faculty and junior faculty, faculty and both academic and non-academic staff, and so forth.</p> 
                   <p>Where such a relationship develops, the person in the position of greater authority or power must <strong>recuse</strong> him/herself to ensure that he/she does not exercise any supervisory or evaluative function over the other person in the relationship. Where such recusal is required, the recusing party must also <strong>notify</strong> his/her supervisor, department chair, dean or human resources manager, so that person can ensure adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements are put in place. Such notification is always required where recusal is required. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely fashion will itself be considered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.</p> 
                   <p>The University has the option to take any action necessary to ensure compliance with the spirit of this policy, including transferring either or both employees to minimize disruption of the work group.</p>

                   <p>If there is any doubt whether a relationship falls within this policy, individuals should disclose the facts and seek guidance rather than fail to disclose. Questions may be addressed to your supervisor or cognizant dean or to the SHARE Title IX Office, or in confidence to the University Ombuds or the School of Medicine Ombuds. In those rare situations where it is programmatically infeasible to provide alternative supervision, academic responsibility and/or evaluation, the cognizant dean, director or supervisor must approve all (as applicable) academic responsibility, evaluative and compensation actions.<br> <br> Employees who engage in sexual or romantic relationships with a student or other employee contrary to the guidance, prohibitions and requirements provided in the policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, depending on the nature of and context for the violation. They will also be held accountable for any adverse consequences that result from those relationships.</p> 
                   <p>Stanford’s policy with regard to employment of related persons can be found in the Administrative Guide 2.1.2.2c and is excerpted here:</p> 
                   <p><em>Employment by a related person in any position (e.g. regular staff, faculty, other teaching, temporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can occur only with the approval of the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person within the organizational unit), or his/her designee. Under no circumstances may a supervisor hire or approve any compensation action for any </em><em>employee to whom the supervisor is related. An individual may not supervise, evaluate the job performance, or approve compensation for any individual with whom the supervisor is related.</em><br> <br> <em>Even when the criteria discussed here are met, employment of a related person in any position within the organization must have the approval of the local human resources office, in addition to the approval of the hiring manager's supervisor, including faculty supervisors.&nbsp;</em></p>

Stanford expects all members of the university community to adhere to and act in accordance with this policy.</li> 
                    <li>This policy describes the responsibilities of Program Staff and informs all members of the university community of their obligation to report any instances of inappropriate behavior involving Minors (see Section 7: Appropriate Behavior with Minors). Failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this policy may lead to disciplinary action (up to and including termination) and/or revocation of the opportunity to use Stanford facilities and land.</li> 
                    <li>Although Stanford is committed to the welfare and appropriate treatment of all Minors, the administrative requirements of this policy do not apply to programs or activities involving:

                      <li>Patient care-related activities pertaining to Minors at Stanford Hospital or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. These activities are addressed in relevant health care policies.</li>

                    <li>The Program Staff background check and training requirements of this policy do not apply for individual events lasting one day or less. However, these events must still be registered with University Human Resources and have adequate adult supervision, and Program Staff must abide by Stanford's Guidelines for Appropriate Behavior with Minors.

                   <p>Signature authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to sign or otherwise enter into an agreement on behalf of the University.</p> 
                   <p>Delegated signature authority is required to sign or enter into agreements (which are inclusive of any form of written or oral contracts that create any legal obligations for the university, as further described below) or otherwise bind or obligate the university to a financial or a non-financial commitment.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Note that signature authority for many types of agreements is reserved for specific university offices. See the Reserved Authority section for additional details.</p>

                   <p>Financial approval/PTA authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to spend or approve the commitment of university funds within the scope of their management responsibility, such as a school, department or administrative unit. Generally, this type of authority is delegated within the university financial systems (as defined below) and pertains only to the approval of transactions within university financial systems. Financial approval authority does not include signature authority as described above or other reserved authority as described below. Additionally, sufficient financial approval authority is required for all transaction approvals, including projects that have already received budget approval. An individual may be delegated financial approval authority for a specific project or initiative by the President or Board of Trustees that is greater than their normal financial authority, for example with respect to a large capital project.</p>

                   <p>Individuals entering into an agreement on behalf of the university must have signature authority that has been explicitly delegated from the Board of Trustees or via the sub-delegation process from the President.</p> 
                   <p>When an action is within one’s signature authority delegation, the delegate must exercise sound business judgment, including:</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Regardless of the scope of an individual’s delegated authority, execution of certain types of transactions and agreements is reserved for specific offices within the university, as further described in the applicable policies referenced below.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Accepting Gifts on Behalf of the University</strong></p> 
                   <p>In general, only Office of Development (OOD) may accept gifts (e.g., cash, property, charitable gift trusts or other types of assets) on behalf of the university. In limited circumstances, individual departments (e.g., libraries and museums) are authorized to accept certain types of gifts (e.g., books, archival materials, and arts). OOD should be consulted in the gift solicitation and acceptance process&nbsp;as stated in <a href="http://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-4/subchapter-2/policy-4-2-1">AGM 4.2.1: Receiving and Processing Gifts</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Construction or Remodeling</strong></p> 
                   <p>Construction of new buildings or remodeling involving a major exterior design change is managed through <a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Lands, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)</a>. Within policy, LBRE may grant approval for Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP), facility and infrastructure projects that are managed by staff within individual schools and departments; see the&nbsp;<a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/pmr/publications/departmentally-managed-projects-dmp-policy" target="_blank">Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP) policy</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Employment Policies</strong></p> 
                   <p>The Provost, for faculty and academic staff appointments, and the Vice President for University Human Resources, for regular staff and contingent positions, have responsibility for establishment of employment policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Investments</strong></p> 
                   <p>Stanford Management Company (SMC) has signature authority for its management of the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool, and any other investments that it manages or administers. Signature authority related to the School &amp; Department Investment funds is documented in individual delegation letters for the applicable School/VP Area. SMC reserves the authority to direct other pools of investment capital not managed by SMC as needed to avoid conflicts with the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Purchasing</strong></p> 
                   <p>University Procurement, within Financial Management Services, has responsibility for purchasing, placing orders and executing contracts for goods and services for the university, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition. Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the university, with the exception of sub-delegations that have been granted by the University President or otherwise approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs &amp; CFO. Procurement maintains the list of exceptions&nbsp;as stated in <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-5/subchapter-1/policy-5-1-1">AGM 5.1.1: Procurement Policies</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Individuals with sufficient financial approval authority may make purchases of commercially available off-the-shelf items and related services of $25,000 or less as long as the purchase does not require a signed agreement. These purchases must be reasonable and necessary, consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.</p> 
                   <p>Intra-university service agreements, such as requests to university service centers for catering, maintenance or telecommunication services, are outside the purview of University Procurement and may be signed and negotiated by the applicable office and academic unit, as long as the transaction is routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Financial Accounts and Debt Issuance</strong></p> 
                   <p>Opening, maintaining and closing bank accounts is restricted to authorized staff members within the Office of the Treasurer (OoT). Additionally, OoT has responsibility for debt issuance. See <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-3/subchapter-6/policy-3-6-1">AGM 3.6.1: Bank Accounts</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Related Entities</strong></p> 
                   <p>The authority to create, acquire, dispose of or terminate legal entities is reserved to the Office of General Counsel and the Vice President of Business Affairs &amp; CFO, except as otherwise provided in the applicable policy. See <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-3/subchapter-7/policy-3-7-1">AGM 3.7.1: Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Research-Related Agreements</strong></p> 
                   <p>The authority to sign research-related agreements for sponsored grants, contracts, awards, and sub-awards is reserved to the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/office-research-administration">Office of Research Administration</a> (ORA), the <a href="http://otl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Technology Licensing</a> (OTL), the <a href="https://ico.sites.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Industrial Contracts Office</a>, and the <a href="http://rmg.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">School of Medicine Research Management Group</a> (RMG).</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Internal Transfer of Expense</strong></p> 
                   <p>Internal transfer of expense, from one PTA to another, is not subject to this policy as long as the original approval of the expense was consistent with the policy documented above. However, the journal transaction must be routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority. Reference <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-3/subchapter-2/policy-3-2-2">Administrative Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers</a> for details.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDAs)</strong></p> 
                   <p>The principle of openness in research, as stated in <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conduct-research/openness-research" target="_blank">Research Policy Handbook 1.4: Openness in Research</a>, sets forth freedom of access by all interested persons to the underlying data, processes, and final results of research, is of overriding importance at Stanford University. Because the university’s “open” environment is not conducive to maintaining confidentiality, generally, the university does not sign NDAs.</p> 
                   <p>Principal Investigators, researchers, or others (collectively “Recipients”) may wish to accept confidential information, materials, or technology from a third-party sponsor or supplier that requires execution of a NDA. Recipients cannot sign on behalf of the university. However, Recipients may individually take responsibility for the acceptance and protection of the information, materials or technology being shared.</p> 
                   <p>Standard NDA templates are available from <a href="https://otl.stanford.edu/industry/sample-agreements-and-forms" target="_blank">Office of Technology Licensing (OTL)</a> and <a href="https://ogc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Office of General Counsel (OGC)</a>.</p> 
                   <p>If the sponsor or supplier agrees to use the university’s template without modifications, recipients may sign it with no further review.</p> 
                   <p>Recipients should be aware that sponsor or supplier requested terms in NDAs may violate university policy. Therefore, if the sponsor or supplier presents their own template or requests modifications to the university’s template, Recipients should consult with <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/offices">OSR</a>, <a href="http://otl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">OTL</a>, the <a href="http://rmg.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Research Management Group (RMG)</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="25" href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/directory/activity/11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procurement Services Contracts Office</a>&nbsp;or OGC prior to signing.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs)</strong></p> 
                   <p>While generally discouraged, in rare circumstances an MOU or LOI may be needed to advance a new relationship in anticipation of future formal agreements.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>See the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/definitions-and-types-agreements/memoranda-understanding-and-letters-intent" target="_blank">Research Policy Handbook (RPH)</a> for the full policy statement for such agreements, including a link to a standard MOU template.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Click-through Agreements</strong></p> 
                   <p>“Click-through” agreements are generally used in online transactions, such as purchasing of online services or licensing of software product, where a user is required to agree to terms prior to using the product or service. Click-through agreements can be legally binding and therefore are subject to this policy.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>If the click-through agreement creates binding obligations on the University, please review the terms before you click “accept” to ensure that the agreement does not contain terms that violate university policies. Examples of problematic terms include:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>Terms that involve use, license or transfer of the university’s name, logo, trademark, patents, copyright, and/or other intellectual property, including for marketing or other promotional purposes&nbsp;</li> 
                    <li>Terms that may violate the university’s policies on openness in research</li> 
                    <li>Terms that may commit the university to binding obligations that are beyond the scope of the user’s delegated authority</li> 
                    <li>Terms that may conflict with the university’s privacy and security policies and guidelines. For example, click-through agreements should generally not be used for services involving the storage, receipt, processing or publishing of moderate risk or high risk data (e.g. unpublished research data, student records, protected health information, other personally-identifiable information) unless the service providers are reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>Please consult with Procurement if you require assistance with a click-through agreement that may bind the university. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the university will not be bound to any click-through term or condition that conflicts with this policy or other university policies and guidelines. Also, please visit <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/software" target="_blank">Essential Stanford Software</a> or <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/dept/its/cgi-bin/services/software/portal/" target="_blank">Software at Stanford</a> for information on software available to use or purchase.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Hiring Decisions</strong><br> Hiring decisions for regular University staff positions are based on the relative job-related qualifications of the applicants for the positions, with full consideration of the employment rights and preferences specified in Section 2.b.</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>The hiring supervisor is responsible for judging the relative qualifications of each applicant and for making the hiring decision, consistent with University policy and applicable governmental laws and regulations.</li>

                   <p><strong>(2) Conditional Offer of Employment</strong>—A written conditional offer of employment must be issued by the hiring department to the successful candidate using an approved offer letter template. Approved templates include those for standard hires, promotions and out-of-country hires. If a background check is required by policy, the written conditional offer of employment will inform the candidate that the offer is contingent upon successfully completing and passing a background check.</p>

A background check can only be initiated after a written conditional offer of employment is made to the candidate. Local Human Resources Offices will provide information on specific requirements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Criminal Records</strong><br> A criminal record will not automatically disqualify a candidate from employment with the university. University Human Resources/Employee &amp; Labor Relations will conduct an individualized assessment of any criminal record revealed during the background check process.

                   <p><strong>(5) Retention Time</strong><br> The hiring department must retain records relating to a search, selection and employment decision for a minimum of two years following the decision.

                   <p><strong>Guide to Supervisors</strong>—Supervisors are cautioned that “notes to the file” and other documentation not addressed to the employee do not belong in the employee personnel file. The following list provides some examples of the types of documents that should be retained, but separate from the personnel file.</p> 
                   <p>Contact your local Human Resources office if you are ever in doubt of what to retain and/or where to retain it.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Personnel files are confidential and access is limited to protect employee privacy. See:<br> <a href="/1-1-1">Guide Memo 1.1.1</a>:&nbsp;University Code of Conduct, section 3<br> <a href="/1-5-2">Guide Memo 1.5.2</a>:&nbsp;Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest, section 2.b and 2.e<br> <a href="/6-1-1">Guide Memo 6.1.1</a>:&nbsp;Administrative Computing Systems, section 3.c<br> <a href="/6-2-1">Guide Memo 6.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Computer and Network Usage Policy<br> <a href="/6-4-1">Guide Memo 6.4.1</a>:&nbsp;Identification and Authentication Systems, section 5</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Access by the Employee&nbsp;or Representative</strong><br> Each employee or their authorized representative may review the employee’s own local personnel files by requesting an appointment with the local Human Resources office during regular business hours and non-working time. An employee or their authorized representative may review the employee’s own payroll and related forms by making an appointment with and presenting appropriate identification to the Payroll office. An authorized representative must present a written authorization signed by the employee permitting the representative to make such inspection. Such appointments generally will occur, unless agreed in writing, within 30 days after the written request for inspection is submitted.</p> 
                   <p>A Human Resources or Payroll staff member will remain present during the time the file is reviewed, allowing sufficient inspection time commensurate with the volume of the file. The employee or authorized representative is permitted to take notes during the inspection.</p> 
                   <p>An employee or their authorized representative may also request a copy of the personnel file. The authorized representative must present written proof, signed by the employee, that the representative is authorized to receive a copy of the personnel file. Such a copy will be provided at the employee’s expense within 30 days after a written request is received from the employee or their authorized representative. Requests for a copy of payroll records, however, must be provided within 21 days of receipt of the employee’s request. Current employees can also access their payroll records, including W-2s and time and leave records, at any time in the Axess portal.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Access by a Former Employee</strong><br> A former employee of the University or their authorized representative may request a copy of their personnel file for up to three years after termination. The request must be in writing, and the representative must provide written proof signed by the employee authorizing the representative to request and receive a copy of the personnel file. Generally such requests will be granted once each year and the copy provided within 30 days after receipt of the written request, unless the University and the employee (or authorized representative) agree otherwise. The copy of the file may be provided at the former employee's expense. Requests by a former employee for a copy of their payroll records must be provided within 21-days of receipt of the former employee’s request.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Access by University Officials</strong><br> University officers, managers, deans, department heads, Human Resources professionals, representatives of the General Counsel's office, and other University officials with a business need to do so may review individual files. This access is also extended to hiring officers within the University when the employee is a finalist for promotion or transfer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Access by Summons/Subpoenas </strong><br> Process servers with summons or subpoenas for documents contained in an individual employee's personnel file should be directed to Payroll, or to the Manager of Employee &amp; Labor Relations at SLAC. Departments are not authorized to accept service of summons or subpoenas.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Outside Employment Verification Requests (Former and Current Employees)</strong><br> Stanford does not respond directly to any employment verification requests. Stanford contracts with a third party service supplier to provide employment, salary, and immigration verification services. Employees should follow the instructions at Stanford's <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/payemployee/emp_verification.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a>&nbsp;for employment verification. Requests for information on SLAC employees should be referred to the SLAC Human Resources Department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Access by Agents of the University</strong><br> Agents of the University are required by contract to certify that University personnel data will be treated confidentially and only used for the purposes specified in the contract.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g.</strong> <strong>Requests for Employment References (Former &amp; Current Employees) </strong><br> Requests from outside the University for employment references should be directed to the local Human Resources office. Requests for information about SLAC employees should be referred to the SLAC Human Resources Department. Information other than the dates of employment and job classification requires the employee's written consent before the release of information.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Current Employees</strong><br> An employee's work history at Stanford may include service with many different departments. To streamline recordkeeping, the local personnel files should follow the employee from one department to the next, thereby creating a consolidated personnel file containing the employee's complete job history. Local personnel files must be kept in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access.</p> 
                   <p>No one should be responsible for maintenance of their own personnel file or data. For example, the personnel file of a department or school's file administrator should be maintained by that individual's supervisor or manager, as appropriate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Terminated Employees</strong><br> The final department where a former employee worked is responsible for ensuring that appropriate records are retained for the requisite length of time. Records of former Stanford employees should be retained for eight years following the date of termination.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Destruction of Outdated Information</strong><br> Personnel files contain confidential information and must be destroyed by shredding, incinerating or, in the case of digital records, purged by the system administrator. When the requisite period of data retention has passed, the records should be destroyed. Contact University Human Resources/Employee &amp; Labor Relations or the SLAC Human Resources Department before the destruction or purging of any personnel information.</p>

                   <p>This Guide Memo explains when the hire date from Stanford Health Services (SHS), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH), UCSF Stanford Health Care (USHC), or SHC will be used instead of the new University hire date for certain University benefits for eligible employees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Definitions</strong><br> For purposes of this Guide Memo, the following definitions apply:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Employed</strong>—earning wages or on an approved leave of absence from a regular position eligible for health and welfare benefits with the applicable employer.</li>

                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Direct Change</strong><br> An eligible employee must "change directly" to employment with the University. For purposes of this policy, a direct change occurs when the employee ceases employment with SHC on one business day and commences employment with the University on the next University business day.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Workweek</strong><br> The basic full-time workweek is 40 hours of work on five consecutive eight-hour days. The standard week is a seven-day period commencing at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ending at midnight the following Sunday. Salaried staff employed for a work week of less than the basic 40-hour week receive reduced salary based on the ratio of hours worked to 40 hours. Staff employees who are employed at an hourly rate are paid for the actual time worked.</p> 
                   <p>Straight time is time worked up to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week unless the employee is on an alternative work schedule (see section 6, Alternative Work Schedule).</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Nonstandard Workweek</strong><br> Departments may establish other workweek schedules or work arrangements to meet their requirements, including a workweek that begins and ends on other days or hours than the basic workweek (outlined in section 3.a), if approved in advance by the local Human Resources office. See guidelines at <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manage-lead/employees/manage-your-team/work-life-integration/flexible-work-schedule" target="_blank">Flexible Work Options</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Make-Up Time</strong><br> At the written request of the employee, and with the approval of the supervisor, a non-exempt employee may reduce their work hours for a personal obligation on one day and make up the hours not worked on another day during the same workweek. The employee may do this by working more than eight hours but not more than 11 hours in one day, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be paid unless the total number of hours worked in any one day exceeds 11 hours or the total number of hours worked in any one workweek exceeds 40.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> <strong>Day of Rest</strong><br> Non-exempt employees working more than 30 hours a week are entitled to have at least one day off in seven in compliance with California state law.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Rest Breaks</strong><br> The university provides non-exempt employees a 15-minute paid, duty-free rest break for each four hours of work or "major fraction" of four hours of work (i.e., more than two hours), provided the employees work at least three-and-one-half hours per day. Insofar as practicable, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of each work period.&nbsp;Rest breaks are duty-free time and employees are free to leave the premises, where practicable.<span style="font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Rest breaks should also be arranged so that disruptions of work and services are held to a minimum. Employees are not permitted to use their rest breaks to shorten the workday or to extend the meal period.</span>&nbsp;If a non-exempt employee is not provided the required number of duty-free rest breaks in a day and/or is not relieved of all duty during their rest breaks, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's straight time hourly rate must be paid to the employee.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Meal Periods</strong><!-- br--><br> Meal periods normally are for one hour and are unpaid. Time taken for meal periods is not part of the work day, provided the employee is relieved of all duty. A non-exempt employee must be provided with an unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than five hours of work, and a second meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than ten hours of work, unless the employee waives the right to the second meal period. A non-exempt employee who works no more than six hours in the workday may also waive the right to a meal period if the supervisor approves.&nbsp;Such waivers require the employee’s consent and are recommended to be in writing. Supervisors should consult with their local Human Resources office before agreeing to waive an employee’s meal period.<!-- br--></p> 
                   <p>If a non-exempt employee is not provided with a 30-minute, duty-free meal period and/or is not relieved of all duty during a meal period, then the time must be recorded as work hours. Additionally, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's straight time hourly rate must be paid to the employee&nbsp;for any missed, late, or otherwise non-compliant meal period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g.</strong> <strong>Note to Supervisors</strong><!-- br--><br> Unpaid meal breaks, including actual start and stop times, must be recorded in each employee's Axess Timecard. If a meal break is not provided, a one-hour penalty must also be recorded.</p>

                   <ol> 
                    <li><strong>Records for Non-Exempt Employees</strong><!-- br--><br> Federal and state laws require non-exempt employees to keep an accurate daily record of hours actually worked, including actual start and stop times and meal breaks. Axess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS) is the system of record to indicate hours worked, including overtime hours and vacation, sick, holiday and other leave time taken by each non-exempt employee. In the time-keeping system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period, but it is recommended that employees update their actual work hours each work day. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve non-exempt employees' time records and must approve any variance from the employees' normally scheduled work hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> Also see <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6</a>: Vacations, <a href="/2-1-7">Guide Memo 2.1.7</a>: Sick Time, <a href="/2-1-8">Guide Memo 2.1.8</a>: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences, and <a href="/2-1-13">Guide Memo 2.1.13</a>: Paid Holidays.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Records for Exempt Employees</strong><!-- br--><br> Axess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS), is the system of record to indicate vacation, sick and other leave time taken by each regular exempt employee. In that system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period. For exempt employees it is not necessary to report any vacation, PTO or Floating Holiday time less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours. Sick time may be taken in any increment. In the case of intermittent Family and Medical Leave, the local Human Resources office must be consulted to ensure that (a) accurate records are maintained of time used for Family and Medical Leave, and (b) the employee's leave balance is properly reduced for time charged to intermittent Family and Medical Leave. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve exempt employees' leave records. <!-- br--><br> Also see <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6</a>:&nbsp;Vacations, <a href="/2-1-7">Guide Memo 2.1.7</a>:&nbsp;Sick Time, <a href="/2-1-8">Guide Memo 2.1.8</a>:&nbsp;Miscellaneous Authorized Absences and <a href="/2-1-13">Guide Memo 2.1.13</a>: Paid Holidays.</li>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Employees Exempt from Overtime Compensation</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Definition of Exempt Employee</strong><br> Certain employees hold jobs that are exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work. In general, employees are exempt when employed in executive, administrative or learned, creative or computer professional positions as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act&nbsp;and California law<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. Exempt University employees are not entitled to receive overtime pay.</span></p> 
                   <p>The Vice President for Human Resources or designee determines the exempt or non-exempt status of university classifications. Special circumstances, such as an employee working in more than one job (also referred to as a dual appointment) that may affect their exempt status, must be discussed with the local Human Resources office before hiring employees into additional jobs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Normal Expectations—</strong>Because of the many activities required to keep the university functioning, full-time members of the academic staff and regular exempt staff may be called upon to perform a variety of services for the institution apart from those normally considered to be their regular job duties. These staff members may be assigned these tasks either within their department or for another area within the university.</p> 
                   <p>Further, it is understood that regular academic and exempt staff may often be expected to work in excess of 40 hours a week. Because these situations are considered to fall within the normal expectations for these staff, they would not constitute grounds for payment of additional compensation and the staff member would not receive payment in excess of 100% of the FTE salary.</p>

                     If an employee receives a request to perform additional work for a department other than the employee's home department assignment (whether related or unrelated to the employee's current responsibilities), the employee must receive formal approval in advance from their supervisor or provide notification to the supervisor, depending on the duties:
                    </further,></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>For non-teaching duties,</strong> the employee must receive prior written approval from their current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.</li> 
                    <li><strong>For teaching duties:</strong><br> - If the teaching duties occur outside the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must give prior written notification to their current supervisor and the local Human Resources office.<br> - If preparation and/or teaching duties occur during the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must receive prior written approval from his/her current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Further Information</strong><br> For regular non-bargaining unit staff and academic staff-libraries, contact your Human Resources office.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Overtime Entitlement</strong><br> Any employee holding a non-exempt job and who is required to work more than eight hours in a day, or more than 40 hours in a week, is entitled to compensation in accordance with (1) below. The total hours worked for one or more departments of the university are to be counted in determining overtime even though employment in any one department does not exceed the standard 8-hour day or 40-hour week. University policy provides for overtime payment for hours worked in excess of eight in one day in accordance with state regulations. University policy provides overtime payment for hours worked in excess of 40 in one week in accordance with state and federal regulations. Overtime policies are applicable to non-exempt temporary and/or casual employees as well as to regular non-exempt employees. University requirements and government regulations require that overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees be recorded and compensated.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Overtime Rate</strong><br> The university's policy is to compensate non-exempt employees at a premium rate of one-and-one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay. For non-exempt employees, the regular rate is the weekly salary,&nbsp;including any applicable premiums required to be added by law,&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">divided by regular, non-overtime hours worked</span>.&nbsp;For non-exempt employees who are paid more than one hourly rate in a pay period,&nbsp;the overtime rate will be calculated based on the weighted average method.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Non-exempt employees who work in excess of 12 hours per workday or in excess of eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a single work week will be compensated for those excess hours at the rate of twice their regular rate of pay.</li> 
                    <li>Overtime Rates:</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. </strong>Time and one-half: hours eight through 12 in one workday<br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>b. </strong>Double-time: hours after 12 in one workday</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>c. </strong>Time and one-half: first eight hours on seventh consecutive workday</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>d. </strong>Double-time: after eight hours on seventh consecutive workday</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>e. </strong>Time and one-half: after 40 hours in one work week, unless a double-time premium applies</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Overtime Hours</strong><br> Authorized paid time off (e.g., vacation, sick leave, personal time off, holidays, etc.) counts as time worked in determining if a non-exempt employee is entitled to overtime compensation. Leave without pay does not count as time worked.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Overtime Limitations</strong><br> Overtime work is to be kept to a minimum because of costs. Departments should permit overtime work by non-exempt employees only when it is essential to the operation of the department. State law prohibits persons under age 18 from working more than eight hours per day under any circumstances.</p> 
                   <p><strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(4) Approval of Overtime Work</span></strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Overtime work by non-exempt employees requires approval in advance by the department head or a designated representative who has the authority to schedule work and approve overtime compensation. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to schedule or approve overtime work for themselves. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to work unpaid overtime. In circumstances where a part-time employee plans to work in more than one job for the same or other department(s), the employee’s supervisors should contact the local Human Resources office for consultation on both topics before implementation.</span>&nbsp;In the event an employee works overtime without obtaining the prior approval of their supervisor, the overtime hours must be paid, but the failure of the employee to follow this provision can be addressed through corrective action.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(5) Approval of Extended Overtime</strong><br> Departments finding it necessary to schedule overtime for one or more employees on a regular basis for six months or longer as the only means of meeting work requirements, must obtain approval in advance from the appropriate Vice President or Vice Provost.</p>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Definition</strong><br> "Alternative work week" refers to a&nbsp;schedule that allows non-exempt employees to work a<span style="font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">standard work week (40 hours) that is condensed into fewer than five full days. A common alternative work week schedule is four 10-hour days.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Guidelines</strong><br> Guidelines for <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/flexible-work/flexible-work-arrangements-policies" target="_blank">Flexible Work Options</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Administrative Considerations</strong><br> Managers should consider their operational needs before implementing an alternative work schedule. For example, an alternative work schedule may be used in the academic departments where expanded service hours are needed to accommodate client needs during irregular hours (e.g., students or clients in other time zones), but may be impractical when 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. coverage is the priority.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Alternative Work Schedule Election</strong><br> Upon secret ballot election by affected employees conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws, and with the concurrence of management, non-exempt employees may work an "alternative work week," such as four 10-hour work days, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be due unless the employee works more than 40 hours in any one week, or the supervisor compels the employee to work more than the agreed upon hours in any work day. No alternative work schedule for non-exempt employees may be implemented unless it meets all legal requirements and prerequisites and is reviewed in advance by Employee &amp; Labor Relations in University Human Resources. Contact your local Human Resources office if you are interested in exploring the option of implementing an alternative work schedule, or consult with Employee &amp; Labor Relations and review these guidelines for <a href="https://hr.stanford.edu/processes/employee-labor-relations/flexible-work-options-consultation" target="_blank">alternative work schedules or flexible work options</a>.</p>

Call-Back Time</strong><br> "Call-back" time occurs when a non-exempt employee responds to an emergency call and returns to work outside their normal working hours without advance notice. The minimum compensation for "call-back" time is two hours pay. Compensation for "call-back" time includes all hours worked, including the actual time spent traveling to and from the "call-back" duty.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Standby and Beeper Pay</strong><br> Employees away from work may be required to remain accessible for consultation or to return to work. Non-exempt employees assigned such duties are eligible to receive partial salary for the duration of the assignment depending on the extent to which<span style="font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">that assignment restricts their personal activities.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Beeper Pay</strong><br> If that restriction is limited to carrying a "beeper," cell phone or similar device, and remain within range of the device, <strong><em>and</em></strong> be&nbsp;required to return any beeper page or call&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">within 20 minutes, the partial salary is 5% of the employee's base pay for hours assigned to beeper duty, but not at work (called "beeper pay").&nbsp;</span>Any time spent by the employee answering pages or calls or returning to work is compensable at the employee’s base rate of pay or overtime regular rate, as applicable.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(2) Standby Pay</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">If the restriction is narrower than discussed in (1) above, and the assignment requires the employee</span> to be prepared to return<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;instantly to return to work, the partial salary is 50% of the employee's base pay</span>&nbsp;(which must be at least the minimum wage)<span style="font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">for hours assigned to standby duty, but not at work (called "standby pay").&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Shift Pay</strong><br> Shift premiums are paid to non-exempt full-time employees assigned to shifts other than daytime schedules. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to swing shifts (shifts starting between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.) will be paid a 10% shift premium. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to owl/night shifts (shifts starting between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.) will be paid a 15% shift premium.&nbsp;This provision does not apply to sworn officers in the Department of Public Safety.</p>

"Straight-time pay" for the purpose of vacation accrual includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation, and sick time. (For more information, see <a href="/2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Compensation of Staff Employees.)

                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(1) Vacation Does Accrue</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Vacation accrues from the first month of employment during non-overtime periods of work, sick time, and vacation. During seasonal layoff, vacation accrues as if the employee were continuing to work regular time. Vacation is credited at the end of each month of service.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(2) Vacation Does Not Accrue</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">No vacation accrues:</span></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>During any period of terminal vacation, pursuant to section 2.g.(2).</li> 
                    <li>During periods of leave with or without pay, including periods of short-term disability, long-term disability, Workers' Compensation, or when using Family Temporary Disability wage replacement (FTD).</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>e. Maximum Vacation Accumulation</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Accrual Limits</strong><br> Unused vacation accumulates from year to year, but the maximum amount of vacation that a full time employee can accrue is 240 hours (30 work days). If an employee has accrued the maximum, vacation ceases to accrue Vacation time will again accrue after the employee uses vacation time and the balance falls below 240 hours. The employee is not credited any vacation not earned due to having reached the 240 hour accrual maximum. New accruals will not exceed the 240 hour maximum.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Accrual Limits for Part-time Employment</strong><br> The maximum allowable accrual is prorated based on the eligible employee's FTE.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Approval for Exceptions</strong><br> Any exception to the maximum allowable accrual must be requested in writing in advance by the employee's department, must identify the unique operational requirements that warrant the exception, and must be directed to the Vice President for Human Resources. Only the Vice President for Human Resources may grant an exception to the accrual maximum.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Change in Status</strong><br> When an employee's change in status from full-time to part-time results in an employee's vacation accumulation exceeding the employee's new maximum, the employee is paid for the excess at the time of the status change unless the employee and the employee's department mutually agree upon arrangements for the excess to be taken within a short period of time. Such arrangements can provide for a combination of payment and vacation. Payment is based on the pay rate that was in effect immediately before the status change.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>No Advance on Vacation </strong><br> Employees may not use vacation before it has been credited, except for borrowing up to the amount the employee would normally accrue in one month to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during Winter Closure.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Scheduling of Vacations</strong><br> Departments are responsible for providing opportunities for employees to take vacations each year. Vacation should normally be taken in the fiscal year when it is accrued. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with depart-mental operational needs, and should consider the employee's preferences. If an employee has not scheduled vacation, they may be required to use accrued vacation time before the close of the fiscal year in which it was accrued, or before the close of a grant or contract that supports the employee's salary.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Reporting Vacation Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">­<strong>(1) Non-Exempt Employees</strong><br> Record all vacation time taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (HRMS).</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2) Exempt Employees</strong><br> Vacation time is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.</p> 
                   <p><span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_698S" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_693S" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><strong>d.</strong> <span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_687S" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_682S" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Use of Vacation for Non-vacation Absences</strong><br> Vacation accruals can be used for other absences (e.g., disability, personal, Winter Closure) when requested by the employee and approved by the supervisor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Advance Pay for Vacations </strong><br> See <a href="/2-2-3">Guide Memo 2.2.3</a>:&nbsp;University Payroll.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Pay in Lieu of Vacation</strong><br> Vacation accruals cannot be converted to cash except when employment terminates or when a change in employment status results in an employee's accumulation exceeding the maximum allowable (see 1.e.(1) above).</p> 
                   <p><strong>g.</strong> <strong>Vacation Payment upon Termination</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Lump Sum Payment.</strong> At the termination of their regular staff employment with Stanford University, employees receive a lump sum payment at their current rate of pay for their accrued vacation and any unused PTO time and Floating Holiday hours.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Terminal Vacation.</strong> Terminal vacation is a benefit the university offers to employees who are retiring pursuant to <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-10">Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement</a> or being laid off, in which the affected employee may elect to use their accrued vacation, unused PTO, and Floating Holiday hours in the period immediately following the employee's last day of active work. The time is used at the work commitment level held at retirement or layoff (e.g., a full-time employee will use 8 hours per day) to remain on the payroll. Any remaining accruals that are less than a full day are paid out to the employee on the last full day of terminal vacation.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. Eligibility: Only employees who are retiring or being permanently laid off may elect to use unused Vacation accruals, Floating Holiday time and PTO hours after the last day of actual work.&nbsp;Employees who are being permanently laid off and are given pay in lieu of notice are not eligible for terminal vacation and will be paid their accrued and unused Vacation, Floating Holiday and PTO hours on their last day of employment. Employees who are involuntarily terminated but who may qualify to retire under <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-10">Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement</a> are also not eligible for terminal vacation.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b. Notice: A laid off employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation within seven (7) calendar days of receiving notice of layoff. A retiring employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the last day of active work.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">c. Additional Employment: While an employee is receiving terminal vacation pay, they cannot be employed in any other Stanford University position.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">d. Effect of Terminal Vacation:&nbsp;If the laid off employee elects to take terminal vacation, the new layoff effective date or retirement effective date will be the last day of the terminal vacation period. The severance repayment period and the laid off employee’s bridge period begins on the following business day.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>h.</strong> <strong>Leaves of Absence</strong><br> An approved leave of absence without pay is not a termination of employment and lump-sum payment of accumulated vacation is not provided when an employee takes leave without pay.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Changing <strong>Positions</strong></strong><br> When an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding vacation time, including policies regarding vacation time use and limits on vacation time accruals.<br> <br> <strong>j. Fixed-Term Appointees and Employees on Fixed Funding</strong><br> Employees on fixed-term appointments and regular staff employees paid from fixed funding sources may be required to use all accrued vacation before the end of the fixed-term appointment period or the expiration of the funding source.</p> 
                   <p><strong>k.</strong> <strong>Non-exempt Employees Working Premium Shifts</strong><br> Employees who regularly work swing or owl/night shifts (see <a href="/2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Compensation of Staff Employees, Section 7.c) and thus normally receive shift premium pay continue to receive shift premium pay for hours charged to vacation leave.</p>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Eligibility</strong><br> Regular staff employees of the University delineated in the Applicability section above accrue and use sick time as described below.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Accrual of Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Regular staff employees accrue sick time as follows: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>Exempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of 8 hours per month of full-time pay.</li> 
                      <li>Non-exempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of .046154 hours per hour of straight time. This equates to 96 hours or 12 days a year in an average year of 2,080 straight time hours.</li> 
                      <li>For part-time and part-month employment, sick time is credited on a prorated basis for any month a regular staff employee receives any straight-time pay. Straight-time pay for this purpose includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation and sick.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Accrual for an exempt regular staff employee who is employed part-time or part-month is based on the proportion of the regular staff employee with 100% FTE.</span></li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                    <li>Unused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with no maximum limit.</li> 
                    <li>When changing positions:&nbsp;When a regular staff employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains his/her sick time. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time, including policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals. If a regular staff employee's acceptance of a new position results in a limit on sick time accruals due to the policy applicable to the new position, any sick time in excess of the limit will be returned to the employee's accruals if the employee returns to a regular staff employee position consistent with the service bridging timelines set out in Section 2 of <a href="/2-1-2" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2</a>: Recruiting &amp; Hiring of Regular Staff.</li> 
                    <li>No advance:&nbsp;Sick time must be accrued before it can be used.</li> 
                    <li>During temporary layoff, sick time accrues as if the laid-off regular staff employee continued to work regular time. (For more information, see Section 2 of <a href="/2-1-17">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.17</a>:&nbsp;Layoffs).</li> 
                    <li>If a regular staff employee separates from the University in good standing and is rehired by the University into a regular staff employee position within 12 months from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated. In the case of a layoff, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated if the regular staff employee is rehired into a regular staff employee position within 24 months from the date of layoff. (For more information about the University's policy regarding bridging of service, see <a href="/2-1-2" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2</a>: Recruiting &amp; Hiring of Regular Staff.)</li> 
                    <li>Sick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.</li> 
                    <li>A maximum of 24 hours or three scheduled workdays of protected sick time use per year, whichever is greater, may be used pursuant to the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522. After this amount of sick time has been used, regular staff employees may use remaining sick time pursuant to this Guide Memo 2.1.7, and the remaining sick time is not subject to the protections of the California Paid Sick Leave Law.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. No Sick Time Accrues</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>No sick time accrues during periods of leave with or without pay beginning 8/1/05 or later, including short-term disability, long-term disability, worker's compensation and family temporary disability wage replacement (FTD).</li> 
                    <li>No sick time accrues during a laid off or retiring regular staff employee's use of terminal vacation. (For more information, see <a href="/2-1-6" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.6</a>: Vacations.)</li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Illness or Injury</strong><br> Sick time may be used when a regular staff employee's illness or injury prevents the regular staff employee from working.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Medical and Dental Appointments</strong><br> Sick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments. Medical and dental appointments may also be charged to vacation, PTO or floating holiday. Medical and dental appointments include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition</li> 
                    <li>Preventive care</li> 
                    <li>Appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking</strong><br> Sick time may be used by a regular staff employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking in order to:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Obtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, restraining order or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the victim or his/her child</li> 
                    <li>Seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking</li>

                    <li>Participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, including a temporary or permanent relocation</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. University Holidays and Sick Time</strong><br> For holidays that occur on days when a regular staff employee's absence due to illness/injury is fully charged to sick time, and the regular staff employee is not on other leave status, the time off is charged as a paid holiday.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. During Vacation</strong><br> When a regular staff employee is hospitalized or confined to bed by medical direction while on vacation, the time of hospitalization/confinement should be charged to accrued sick time. If appropriate, a claim should be submitted for disability plan benefits. (For instructions about submitting a disability claim, see <a href="/2-3-5" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>:&nbsp;Disability and Family Leaves.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.</strong> <strong>During Winter Closure</strong><br> If a regular staff employee has to use vacation, PTO or floating holiday for certain days during Winter Closure, accrued sick time may be used instead but only in the following limited circumstances:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> Sick time may be used for days during Winter Closure that occur within an approved medical leave period, provided the regular staff employee was on the approved medical leave immediately prior to Winter Closure.<br> <strong>(2) </strong>Sick time may be used for days during Winter Closure for which Lincoln Financial approved or approves disability or family temporary disability payments and for which days the regular staff employee needs to use paid sick time in order to maintain base pay. (For more information, see <a href="/2-3-5" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>: Disability and Family Leaves.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Family Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) Family Sick Time</strong><br> Regular staff employees may use a maximum of 15 sick days during a calendar year of service (January 1 to December 31) for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a regular staff employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes only the regular staff employee's:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 80px;"> 
                    <li>Spouse or registered domestic partner</li> 
                    <li>Children of the regular staff employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the regular staff employees stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child's age or dependency status</li> 
                    <li>Parents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a regular staff employee or the regular staff employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the regular staff employee was a minor)</li> 
                    <li>Brothers and sisters</li> 
                    <li>Grandparents or grandchildren</li> 
                    <li>Other family member dependent on the regular staff employee and living in the regular staff employee's household</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> Regular staff employees may also apply for family sick leave. (For instructions about submitting a family sick leave claim, see <a href="/2-3-5">Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>:&nbsp;Disability and Family Leaves.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>h.</strong> <strong>Use of Sick Time to Maintain Pay during Disability</strong><br> Unless the regular staff employee applies to his/her department in writing for an exception, which is approved, the university uses a regular staff employee's accrued sick time to maintain the regular staff employee's base pay during times when the regular staff employee is receiving disability benefits payments. (For more information, see <a href="/2-3-5" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>:&nbsp;Disability and Family Leaves.)<br> <br> <strong>j. Unacceptable Use of Sick Time:</strong><br> Unless otherwise specifically allowed by this Guide Memo 2.1.7, sick time may only be used for an absence that a regular staff employee has during scheduled work hours.</p>

                 <div class="policy-subsection-container policy-subection-container-22955">
                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="administration"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Administration</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Notification of Absence</strong><br> The regular staff employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how regular staff employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. The first 24 hours or three scheduled workdays of accrued sick time use per year of employment, whichever is greater, shall not be denied for a regular staff employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. Regular staff employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules are possible for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a regular staff employee's work hours.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use</strong><br> The University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used and accumulated for all regular staff employees. Records must be updated each pay period for all employees who used sick time. (For more information, see <a href="/2-1-5" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Compensation of Staff Employees. For information about Axess see the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html">Time &amp; Leave System</a> overview.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Sick Time Credit Date</strong><br> Sick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service. An adjustment is made at the beginning of the following month when the actual accrual is different than anticipated.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Tax Status</strong><br> Sick time is taxable income. Federal, state, and FICA taxes are deducted.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Medical Confirmation</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time</strong><br> Acceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a regular staff employee's use of the first 24 hours of sick time (or three scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a regular staff employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time</strong><br> If the University has reasonable basis to believe that a regular staff employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 24 hours or three scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a regular staff employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence</strong><br> Acceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner's statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when a regular staff employee is released to return to work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.</strong> <strong>Applying for Disability</strong><br> A regular staff employee must apply for disability benefits if using sick time for more than 5 consecutive working or 7 consecutive calendar days for the same illness or injury.</p>

                   <p>Paid absences approved in advance count as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime payment [refer to <a href="/2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>: Compensation of Staff Employees, section 5.b(3)]. The university authorizes these absences: Vacations in <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6</a>, Sick Time in&nbsp;<a href="/2-1-7">Guide Memo 2.1.7</a>, and Paid Holidays in <a href="/2-1-13">Guide Memo 2.1.13</a>. In addition, the following absences with continuation of pay are authorized by the university:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Voting</strong><br> When a regular full-time employee, because of the work schedule, is not able to vote outside of regularly scheduled work hours, supervisors shall authorize necessary time off, but not to exceed two hours with pay. Such time off should be scheduled when least disruptive to the department's work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Jury Duty</strong><br> A regular employee summoned to jury duty receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court. The employee retains any payments received from the court. The employee must provide verification from the court or jury commissioner of time spent on required jury duty.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Court Appearances</strong><br> A regular employee subpoenaed as a witness in a non-work-related matter receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court.</p> 
                   <p>Absences to appear as a plaintiff or defendant in a non-work-related matter should be charged to personal time off, vacation leave, or personal leave without pay.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> <strong>Personal Time Off</strong><br> (1) Use of Personal Time Off<br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">A regular employee may take time off from scheduled work for personal reasons with the supervisor's prior approval. An appropriate use of available Personal Time Off (PTO) is to continue pay during winter close. A full-time employee may use a maximum of 24 hours of paid time off for their personal reasons each year. The maximum allowance per year should be pro-rated for newly hired or rehired employees, and for part-time employees.</span></p> 
                   <p>PTO is available at the beginning of the calendar year. Employees may "borrow" up to their full amount of PTO before it is credited to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during winter close. PTO may not be carried forward from year to year. If the employee is to be terminated and has unused PTO, arrange for the employee to take PTO before termination. Any remaining unused PTO is paid in the employee's final paycheck.</p> 
                   <p>(2) Reporting Personal Time Off</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Non-Exempt Employees: </strong>Record all PTO taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Exempt Employees: </strong>PTO is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>(3) Scheduling Personal Time Off</p> 
                   <p>An employee&nbsp;is not obligated to explain how they intend to use personal time off. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with departmental operational needs.</p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(4) Change in Status</span></p> 
                   <p>When an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their unused PTO. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding PTO, including policies regarding PTO use and limits on PTO allowance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.</strong> <strong>PTO Augmenting Disability Payments</strong><br> Unless the employee applies to their department for an exception, which is approved, the university uses an employee's accrued time off (sick, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday and vacation, in that order) to maintain the employee's base pay during times when the employee is receiving disability benefit payments. See <a href="/2-3-5">Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>:&nbsp;Disability and Family Leaves, section 6.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Bereavement Leave</strong><br> When there is a death of a close family member of a regular employee, regular pay continues for the necessary period of absence from work, not to exceed five working days. When additional time off is needed, a department may approve use of vacation or personal leave without pay. Definitions of terms used:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Close family member:</strong> limited to the employee's spouse; same-sex domestic partner; children of the employee, spouse or same-sex domestic partner; parents and parents-in-law; parent surrogate; brothers and sisters of the employee; grandparents and grandchildren of the employee; and, any other dependent family member who lived in the employee's residence.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Necessary period of absence: </strong>the time required to attend the funeral or memorial service and discharge related responsibilities. This period is subject to approval by the employee's department.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>h. Military Training Leave</strong><br> When required to perform annual military training duty a regular employee receives time off for the period of actual training, up to 17 calendar days a year. The university supplements the employee's military base pay for the scheduled working days of absence, up to the employee's full salary or wage. Employees must complete one year of employment in order to receive supplemental military training pay from the university. (Refer to section 4.f. for procedures.) See your Human Resources Manager for more information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Paid Organ Donor Leave</strong><br> Under California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence up to 30 days for the purpose of organ donation and up to 5 days for bone marrow donation in any one-year period. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required to the extent permitted by law. For details, see<a href="/2-3-5"> Guide Memo 2.3.5</a>:&nbsp;Disability &amp; Family Leave, section 4.</p> 
                   <p><strong>j. Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies</strong></p> 
                   <p>When the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, determines that a natural disaster, emergency, or certain other extraordinary circumstances prevent regular employees from performing work, paid time off will be provided to those impacted for the first three days of their regularly scheduled time that they are unable to work.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>If the particular circumstances exceed three days, the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, will determine whether and for how long Paid Leave During Natural Disasters and Emergencies will continue, any changes in eligibility requirements, or any changes in compensation or benefits provided. Employees who are not scheduled to work, are on another paid or unpaid leave of absence, or are able and assigned to perform work (for example if an employee can safely work from another location) are not eligible for Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Examples of situations where this policy may apply include natural disasters or other emergencies such as earthquake, wildfire, or inclement weather which cause evacuation, stoppage of operations, or other inability to continue to perform work. There will be notification by the university if such a situation arises.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>These leaves of themselves are unpaid and do not result in the employee receiving pay from the university. Depending on the nature of the leave, however, an employee may be required to use other accrued time off, e.g., accrued vacation, personal time off, or sick time, during the leave or may be eligible to receive disability benefits pursuant to the terms of the university's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Types of Leave of Absence Without Pay</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) Personal Leave</strong><br> A regular employee may be placed on personal leave without pay at a department's discretion. Extra time off in conjunction with paid vacation or time off to take care of family circumstances are examples of situations that may be the basis for granting personal leave.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2) Disability Leave</strong><br> See <a href="/2-1-7">Guide Memo 2.1.7</a>: Sick Time:&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">, and </span><a href="/2-3-5" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Guide Memo 2.3.5</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">:&nbsp;Disability and Family Leaves, for information relating to leaves necessitated by the employee's own injury or illness or the illness of a family member.</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(3) Professional or Educational Leave</strong><br> A regular employee may be granted a leave of absence by a department to pursue activities or educational courses that will enhance the employee's value to the university. This type of leave should not exceed one year. Stanford Benefits must be notified prior to the leave start date for continuation of the university’s contributions toward health benefits plans and retirement savings plan. (Time for participation in training, education, or professional development required and assigned by the department is paid work time. Refer to <a href="/2-1-12">Guide Memo 2.1.12</a>:&nbsp;Staff Development Program, for policy regarding time off with pay to participate in staff training and development programs.)</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(4) Public Service Leave</strong><br> A department may grant a regular employee a leave of absence for temporary participation in community, state, or national affairs, including elective public office. However, long-term or continuing full-time employment by a public or community agency normally is not a suitable basis for approval of a leave of absence.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(5) Military Service Leave</strong><br> A regular employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called for active duty for an extended period should contact their Human Resources Manager for more information. [For short-time periods of military training duty refer to "military training leave" under 1.f. above; for leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel refer to 2.a.(6)-Other Leaves, below.] Certain leaves for family of members of the armed forces are outlined in <a href="/2-1-18">Guide Memo 2.1.18</a>:&nbsp;Military Leave.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(6) Other Leaves</strong><br> The university provides leaves of absence as required by law, such as Volunteer Firefighters Leave, Parent's Leave for School Discipline, Parent's Leave for Children in School, Literacy Leave, time off from work for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, absence from work for victims of crime and certain persons related to victims for judicial proceedings, and leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel while such personnel are on a leave from deployment.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Consult with Employee and Labor Relations for details about any of these leaves.<span id="cke_bm_806E" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Benefits Continuation During Unpaid Absences</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) Benefits Continuation</strong><br> The employee's insurance and health care plans will continue during an unpaid leave of absence if the employee pays their portion of the cost of coverage. Exception: An employee on a personal leave of absence must pay the entire cost of coverage (employee and employer portion). The employee will be billed the appropriate amount for their benefits during the unpaid leave of absence.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(2) Retirement Contributions</strong><br> All retirement plan contributions stop while employees are on an unpaid leave of absence.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(3) Benefits Cancellation</strong><br> An employee on an unpaid leave may choose to cancel coverage during the leave period. If the coverage is not cancelled within 31 days of the start of the leave, the employee will be billed for coverage. To cancel coverage, the employee must take action; visit the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/health/change-your-benefits/employment-changes" target="_blank">Cardinal at Work website</a> or contact the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/contact-us?utm_source=benefits-rewards&amp;utm_medium=nav-link&amp;utm_campaign=Contact" target="_blank">University HR Service Team</a>. The employee can re-enroll in benefits as soon as they return to work in a benefits-eligible position.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Length of Leave</strong><br> Each leave of absence must be for a definite period with specific starting and ending dates. A leave cannot extend beyond the end of a fixed-term appointment. Whenever a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from local Human Resources Manager and the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC. Approval of leaves exceeding 12 months should be rare.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Reinstatement Requirement</strong><br> A department granting or recommending a leave of absence is obligated to reinstate the employee in the same or a similar position at the end of the leave. Under special circumstances, the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) may approve a recommended leave when the employee has waived in writing the reemployment obligation. A leave of absence is not appropriate when the employee cannot provide reasonable assurance of intention to return to University employment at the end of the leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Termination of Leave by Layoff</strong><br> When a layoff situation occurs in a department while an employee is on a leave of absence, normal layoff procedures will apply and will include the employee on leave. If a leave is terminated by layoff, the standard provisions for severance pay, reemployment, and benefits continuation are applicable.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> <strong>Failure to Return from Leave</strong><br> When an employee does not return to work at the end of a leave, or when a department learns that an employee will not return, the department initiates a termination of the leave and of the individual's employee status, citing the reason for the employee's separation.</p> 
                  </div>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Records</strong><br> PeopleSoft/Axess should reflect both paid and unpaid absences indicating the type of leave and the period of absence. Retain in the department files documentation such as evidence of disability and written request for leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Advance Approval</strong><br> When a leave requires advance approval from the Vice President for Human Resources (or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC), the department's request for approval should include the department's written recommendation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Change in Circumstances During Leave Without Pay</strong><br> When any change in circumstances make it necessary to modify a leave of absence, discuss the situation with the Human Resources Manager before any action is taken.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> <strong>Benefit Plan Arrangements</strong><br> Employees on an unpaid leave of absence will be billed by Vita Administration Companies for their insurance and health plan premiums on an after-tax basis. Employees must pay the premiums promptly to Vita.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Work Schedule Modifications</strong><br> Supervisors should adhere to University policies and government requirements regarding overtime pay when modifying a nonexempt employee's work schedule to provide the employee with personal time off. (See <a href="/2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Compensation of Staff Employees, for policies on work scheduling.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.</strong> <strong>Procedures for Military Training Pay</strong><br> The employee should be placed on Leave of Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so health and life benefits are not interrupted. When training leave ends, the employee must provide a copy of the pay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts the employee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equals the usual full-time salary. (See <a href="/2-1-18">Guide Memo 2.1.18</a>: Military Leave.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>g.</strong> <strong>Reemployment Rights of Veterans</strong><br> Any employee who enters military service may have legally guaranteed reemployment rights. When an employee goes into military service, the employee's department should obtain information about these rights from Human Resources.</p>

                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Guide to Supervisors</strong><br> For planning purposes the University requests that employees notify their supervisors as soon as possible of any intention to resign. At least two weeks' prior notice of resignation is expected from non-exempt employees. At least four weeks' prior notice is expected from exempt employees. Supervisors should request that the employee submit a written statement of resignation that includes the date of, and reasons for the resignation. If the employee does not provide a written statement, the supervisor should confirm the oral resignation in writing.</p> 
                   <p>At the supervisor's discretion, along with approval from the local Human Resources Manager, the employee's resignation date may be advanced to an earlier date and pay in lieu of notice given for the remainder of the expected notice period (two weeks for non-exempt employees; four weeks for exempt employees). Pay in lieu of notice may not exceed four weeks.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. University Retirement Plans</strong><br> Income from University retirement plans is available to all participants who are vested in these plans, whether or not they are Official University Retirees. For detailed information about eligibility, contributions, vesting, and benefits please see each plan's Summary Plan Description, available at the<a href="http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards"> Benefits</a>&nbsp;web site.&nbsp;The Summary Plan Description is the official University communication on these plans and contains a description of how each plan operates and participants' rights under the plan and federal law.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Staff Retirement Annuity Plan (SRAP)</strong><br> This retirement plan is for certain employees covered by collective bargaining unit agreements. Additionally, due to certain historical Plan provision changes and participant elections, some exempt and nonexempt staff may either:<br> (a) Be a current participant in SRAP, or<br> (b) Have an accrued SRAP benefit from previous participation while in an active SRAP status.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Stanford Contributory Retirement Plan (SCRP)</strong><br> This retirement plan is for faculty, academic staff and exempt and non-exempt employees. However, due to certain plan provision changes and participant elections, some employees elected to continue participation in SRAP rather than participate in SCRP. The Summary Plan Description is available on the <a href="http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards">Benefits </a>web site&nbsp;in the Resource Library.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Voluntary Tax-Deferred Annuity Plan (TDA)</strong><br> This retirement plan is available to all eligible employees immediately upon hire and is intended to supplement the retirement benefits from Social Security and either the SRAP or SCRP plans. For purposes of this plan, "employee" includes faculty and staff; post doctoral scholars; and temporary, casual and contingent employees. Employees make tax-deferred contributions to this supplemental plan and direct where to invest their contributions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Social Security Retirement Benefits&nbsp;</strong><br> The Social Security program provides retirement benefits to individuals who have worked long enough in covered employment to become fully insured. Reduced benefits are payable to retirees starting at age 62 and before Social Security normal retirement age based on year of birth. Increased benefits result from deferring retirement beyond normal retirement age. After the start of benefits, amounts earned from gainful employment in excess of limits set by law may reduce Social Security payments. Employees and employers pay the costs of the Social Security program. Local offices of the Social Security Administration will provide additional information and assistance with applications for benefits.</p>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Eligibility</strong><br> Only current employees and former employees who have not been terminated for gross misconduct (and informed in writing that they are ineligible for rehire by the University) may qualify to become an Official University Retiree if age and service requirements are met.</p> 
                   <p><strong>1. Employees Hired Before January 1, 1992</strong><br> Employees with a benefits-eligible hire date before January 1, 1992 can qualify as an Official University Retiree one of two ways:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Complete at least 10 years of benefits-eligible service and are at least age 55 at the time of retirement, or</li> 
                    <li>Meet the "Rule of 75" [see (2) below].</li> 
                   </ul>

                   <ul> 
                    <li>At least 10 years of benefits-eligible service, and</li> 
                    <li>Age and years of service total 75 or more.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>This rule is called "The Rule of 75."</p> 
                   <p><strong>3. Gradual Retirement</strong><br> A full-time staff member who qualifies for Official Retiree status but wishes to retire gradually by continuing to work part-time may make such arrangements when mutually acceptable to his/her department (including a department to which an employee is redeployed), in any increment of time, but no more than a total of two (2) years. Retirement benefits will continue to accrue on part-time employment when provided for in the applicable retirement plan.</p> 
                   <p><strong>4. Reemployment of Retirees</strong><br> If a retiree returns to Stanford employment, he or she should call Stanford Benefits at (650) 736-2985 to discuss the effect, if any, on retiree health benefits.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Official University Retiree Benefit Program</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Medical Benefits</strong><br> Official Retirees may participate in a University-provided retiree medical plan. See the Retiree Health &amp; Welfare Summary Plan Description, available at the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards">Benefits</a> web site&nbsp;for detailed information about eligibility, coverage, University contributions, costs and benefits. At age 65, retirees and spouses must apply for and maintain Medicare Parts A and B.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Dental Plans</strong><br> Official Retirees may participate in the University-provided retiree dental plan. See the Retiree Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description for detailed information.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Perquisites</strong><br> Official University Retirees may use University libraries and recreation/ athletic facilities and receive staff discounts for certain athletic events, as provided by the rules and policies of the department which provides the services or facilities. Official University Retirees remain eligible to participate in the Tuition Grant Program.</li>

                   <p><strong>a. Arrangements for Retirement</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> An employee is encouraged to attend a retirement meeting at least 2-3 months prior to his/her potential retirement date.<br> <strong>(2) </strong>Retirement is a form of voluntary termination of employment. See <a href="/2-1-9">Guide Memos 2.1.9</a>:&nbsp;Separation from Employment and <a href="/2-2-3">2.2.3</a>:&nbsp;University Payroll.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Retirement Gifts</strong><br> Departments may use University funds to purchase a retirement gift for the retiree. However, a gift of more than nominal value may be taxable to the recipient as additional income. For more information see <a href="/2-2-10">Guide Memo 2.2.10</a>:&nbsp;Gifts and Awards for University Employees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Reemployment of Retirees</strong><br> When individuals who have retired from the University are reemployed, the provisions of <a href="/2-1-2">Guide Memo 2.1.2</a>:&nbsp;Recruiting and Hiring of Regular Staff, and <a href="/2-2-3">Guide Memo 2.2.3</a>:&nbsp;University Payroll, are applicable.</p> 
                   <p>Health Care: Retirees who are recalled to a benefits-eligible position working between 20-40 hours per week become eligible for the same benefits as an active employee and will need to enroll as such. If a recalled retiree fits these requirements, he/she should call Stanford Benefits at (650) 736-2985. When the recalled retiree terminates employment again, call Stanford Benefits at (650) 736-2985 to re-enroll in retiree medical benefits.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Recalled Retiree</strong><br> If a retiree is receiving payments from SRAP, SCRP or TDA, those benefit payments continue if the retiree is recalled to a benefits-eligible position. In addition, the recalled retiree starts accruing additional retirement benefits based on salary.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="https://stanford.box.com/s/1z029mjdu1jvwpgo288vpmd5q69iq826" rel="nofollow">Staff Grievance Process</a> is located in the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/address-workplace-concern">Address a Workplace Concern</a> section of the Cardinal at Work website.</p>
                    <p><strong>Employee complaints covered by the Staff Grievance Process include written corrective <strong>actions that are placed in an employee’s personnel file (e.g., written warnings)</strong> and involuntary terminations (including layoffs) only. The Staff Grievance Process does not apply to employee complaints <strong>regarding other issues </strong>such as performance appraisals, <strong>Performance Improvement Plans, </strong>compensation/benefits or job classifications. <strong>Information regarding resources to address workplace concerns can be found at <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/address-workplace-concern">Address a Workplace Concern</a>.</strong></strong></p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Regular and effective communication between supervisors and employees reduces the likelihood of misunderstanding and conflict. Stanford University expects and encourages supervisors and employees to communicate openly and regularly so that the interests of the employee and the university are best served. To support this commitment, the university has this Staff Grievance Process and resource offices such as the local Human Resources Office, University Human Resources/Employee &amp; Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff Help Center and the Office of the Ombuds to assist employees in resolving employee complaints.</p> 
                   <p>Before initiating Step 1 of the Staff Grievance Process, the employee is strongly encouraged to make at least one informal attempt to resolve their concerns. If the employee feels uncomfortable in attempting to do this by him/herself, assistance is available through the local Human Resources Office, University Human Resources/Employee &amp; Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff Help Center, or the Office of the Ombuds.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Self-Representation</strong><br> The employee will act as their own representative at each step in the Staff Grievance Process.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Support Person</strong><br> In the case of a grievance that is heard by a Grievance Advisory Board, the employee may choose to have a support person accompany them to the grievance hearing. The employee may select any one university employee who:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>is not employed as an attorney</li> 
                    <li>is both willing and able to attend the hearing without impairing their own work duties, and</li> 
                    <li>receives their supervisor's approval</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Outside Representation</strong><br> The Staff Grievance Process does not allow for outside representation of any kind at any step of the process. If at any time before or during the Staff Grievance Process the employee chooses to elect action related to the grievance issue(s) outside of the internal process (such as filing a charge with the EEOC, DFEH, other administrative body, or a lawsuit), the Staff Grievance Process will be terminated without any decision being reached.</p>

                   <p>STAP assistance may be requested for job-related training, career development, STAP approved Healthy Living offerings through BeWell, and academic pursuit through the Stanford Continuing Studies Program.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Job-Related Training</strong><br> Training must be directly related to performance requirements of the employee's current assignment, and either maintain or improve job skills; be required by law; or respond to organizational or operational need as defined by employee's supervisor including training required to respond to organizational or operational need as defined by the employee's supervisor or the university. STAP does not cover training to meet minimum educational requirements of the current job, or qualify the employee for a new trade or business.</p> 
                   <p>Training may be a formal course given for academic credit or certificate of completion by an accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school; a seminar, workshop or special emphasis short-duration program presented by an approved provider; or training obtained at a conference or professional organization. Online training may be allowable if it meets the requirements outlined in Section 2.a. The employee's supervisor must approve the training in advance. Questions about whether the training or the provider is eligible for STAP should be directed to the Stanford STAP administrator prior to the start of the training course or activity.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Release Time/Time Off with Pay for Required Training</strong><br> An eligible staff employee's supervisor must approve in advance the course as job-related training and approve the release time, if any, to attend the training. Such time off must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked. The department funds time off with pay for training.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Reimbursement</strong><br> Requests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 20 days of satisfactory completion of the training, with the supervisor's approval. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. When employees are reimbursed in advance of course completion, the employee must provide evidence of satisfactory completion to the supervisor. (See Section 5 for procedure).</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Career Development Training</strong><br> Training must be related to an identified and planned training objective for career development. Such training may be a formal course given for academic credit or certificate of completion by an accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school; or be a seminar, workshop or special emphasis short-duration program presented by an approved provider. Career development must only be for training activity that will assist the employee in qualifying for a new position or advancement within his or her current trade or business at Stanford. The employee's supervisor must approve in advance this training and any release time needed to attend.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Release Time/Time Off Without Pay</strong><br> An eligible staff employee may be granted a maximum of 24 hours per month of release time without pay for approved training for career development purposes if no comparable course is offered during non-work hours. Time off for eligible part-time staff should be pro-rated based on the percent time worked. Approval of time off is at the department's discretion and must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Reimbursement</strong><br> Requests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 20 days of the satisfactory completion of the training with the supervisor's approval. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. When employees are reimbursed in advance of course completion, the employee must provide evidence of satisfactory completion to the supervisor (see Section 5 for procedure). For IT Services, Healthy Living and Continuing Studies courses, the STAP allowance will be deducted from the fee when employees register for classes.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Timing of STAP Reimbursement</strong><br> Requests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 20 days of satisfactory completion of the training, with the approval of the supervisor. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. Refer to the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/learn-grow/tuition-training-assistance/staff-training-assistance-program/faq">STAP Frequently Asked Questions</a> for details on the reimbursement process.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Timing of STRP Payment</strong><br> Payment of tuition and covered fees will be made directly to the institution by the program administrator before attendance each quarter or semester. If the employee makes payment directly to the institution, the employee must submit the invoice to the program administrator through a Direct Bill request. The program administrator will make payment directly to the institution, and the institution will issue a credit or reimbursement to the employee.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Departmental Reimbursement</strong><br> When covered costs exceed the current STAP/STRP limit, the excess cost may be partially or fully reimbursed by the employee's department. Departmental reimbursement is at the department's discretion and is determined based on available departmental funds for training. Reimbursement for work-related or career development training may be taxable if the total exceeds $5,250 in one tax year (see Section 7a), regardless of the source of university funds. Departmental reimbursements have the same tax consequences as STAP/STRP reimbursements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Employee Obligation</strong><br> When the University reimburses an employee for training costs through STAP prior to completion of the activity, the employee assumes an obligation to complete the supported training in a satisfactory manner. An employee who does not complete University-reimbursed training must repay the University the total amount of the reimbursement.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Evidence of Satisfactory Completion</strong><br> Employees utilizing funds for training expenses through STAP must provide the supervisor with evidence of satisfactory completion as soon as possible—but no later than 60 days after the training activity is completed. For STRP, evidence of satisfactory completion must be provided to both the supervisor (if supervisor approval was required) and to EdAssist, the STRP administration vendor, within 60 days of the course end date. Such evidence may be an official grade card or transcript from the institution or provider of the course. Failure to submit evidence of course completion within 60 days will require the employee to repay the tuition/fee/expense amount to Stanford and could result in denial of all future requests for tuition assistance. Refer to the STRP Guidelines for details on the Evidence of Satisfactory Completion submission process.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>For undergraduate academic courses using STRP funds, a grade C or better, or pass grade in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of C- or less will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.</li> 
                    <li>For graduate academic courses, using STRP funds, a grade B or better, or pass in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of B- will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.</li> 
                    <li>If a course may be taken for either a letter grade or a pass/fail grade, the employee must take the course for a letter grade to be eligible for STRP funds for this course.</li> 
                   </ul>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. STAP</strong><br> An employee planning a training or development activity should discuss development and performance objectives with his/her supervisor before registering for the course or program. Decisions regarding applicability of training and issues regarding release time should be made at this time. The employee and the supervisor should review career development plans before registration. No application form is needed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Departmental Review</strong><br> The supervisor should review the staff training assistance request and evidence of satisfactory completion, confirming the following:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Employee eligibility (see Section 1)</li>

                   <p><strong>b. STRP</strong><br> Prior to April 30, 2015, employee must submit a completed/signed STRP application to the Tuition &amp; Training Programs Office before the beginning of the designated institution's academic year. The application and instructions can be found on the<a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/learn-grow/tuition-training-assistance/staff-tuition-reimbursement-program" target="_blank"> STRP website</a>. A supervisor's signature is required if release time/time off with pay is requested.</p> 
                   <p>On or after April 30, 2015, employee must submit an application for each term (quarter or semester) no earlier than 90 days prior to the start of classes and no later than 30 days after the start of classes. If a supervisor's signature is required for release time/time off with pay, employee must complete the Supervisor Approval Form. The Supervisor Approval Form can be found and printed from the Stanford My Learning Center website and must be sent to the Stanford STRP office with the employee and supervisor signature within five business days of application submission. Failure to submit the Supervisor Approval Form will result in a denial of the application.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Payment of Tuition and Covered Fees</strong><br> The Direct Bill option should be used to request payment of tuition and fees directly to the employee's school by following the four-step application process in My Learning Center, located on the STRP website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Expense Reimbursement</strong><br> The Expense Reimbursement option should be used if the employee has paid for tuition and/or allowable fees and or expenses. The employee must make the request and submit documentation as proof of payment within 60 days of the course end date.<br> Detailed information about the application, payment and reimbursement process can be found on the STRP website.</p>

Tuition &amp; Training Programs Review</strong><br> The Tuition &amp; Training Programs office monitors and periodically audits applications for conformance with standards of eligibility, applicability and allowability as outlined in this Guide Memo. The Tuition &amp; Training Programs office has final approval over any disputes, of application denial or denial of payment and reimbursements for approved applications. A decision by Tuition &amp; Training Programs office concerning approval or disapproval of applications, payments or reimbursements is not subject to review under any grievance procedure.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>SDP is intended to provide benefits that are, to the extent possible, excluded from taxation under federal and state laws. Accordingly, this Guide Memo constitutes a separate written plan for the exclusive benefit of employees under sections 127 and 132(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations, to provide such employees with educational assistance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. General Rule</strong><br> In general, an employee may exclude up to $5,250 received for graduate or undergraduate education under STRP and up to $800 received under STAP from his/her gross income each tax year for allowable tuition and covered fees and expenses.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Tax Year</strong><br> Employees should note that STRP provides reimbursements of up to $5,250 for each Stanford fiscal year. Because Stanford's fiscal year runs from September 1 through August 31, an employee could be eligible to receive reimbursements in excess of $5,250 for the employee's tax year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Other Situations</strong><br> Amounts paid to an employee in excess of $5,250 may also be excluded if they are payments for certain job-related training, when such training maintains or improves the skills of an employee. However, if the training is necessary for the employee to meet the minimum educational requirements for employment, or if the training will qualify the employee for a new trade or business, the payments will not qualify for this additional exclusion.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Getting Help</strong><br> Employees should consult their personal tax advisor with any questions.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Floating Holiday Policy</strong><br> For regular, full-time employees, 16 (sixteen) hours of floating holiday are available on January 1 (or date of hire for employees hired after January 1) and can be taken on any day or partial day within that calendar year that is mutually agreed upon by the employee and supervisor. For employees working less than full time, the amount of time credited as floating holidays are prorated based on the employee's regularly scheduled work hours.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Reporting Floating Holiday Time</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Non-Exempt Employees: </strong>Record all floating holiday time taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Exempt Employees: </strong>It is not necessary to report any floating holiday time less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Floating Holiday and Winter Closure</strong><br> Employees may "borrow" up to their full amount of the next year's floating holidays to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during winter closure.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> <strong>Guide to Supervisors: Floating Holiday in Cases of Termination</strong><br> If an employee is to be terminated and the earned floating holidays have not been used by the employee, arrangements should be made for the employee to take the floating holidays prior to termination. If this is not possible, report the unused floating holidays on the Termination Web Form. The employee will receive regular pay for the holiday.</p>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Termination Policy</strong><br> Senior Staff may be terminated at any time for any reason, including layoff, or no reason upon the approval of the Dean, Vice Provost, Vice President, Provost or the President and the concurrence of the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee. Such termination is subject to the appropriate administrative review, but will not be subject to review under any grievance procedure in the University. Senior Staff who are terminated by the university receive notice and severance pay as described in section 4.c, except when the President or the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee determines the termination is for gross misconduct. Senior staff who voluntarily resign are not entitled to notice or severance pay.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Policy on Extended Notice</strong><br> Senior Staff receive three months' notice. When pay is given in lieu of notice, the maximum payment period is three months. A combination of notice and pay in lieu of notice may be appropriate at the university's discretion. In such an arrangement, severance pay may be contingent on serving out a specified portion of the notice period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Policy on Payment of Severance Pay</strong><br> Senior staff will be paid a minimum of three months' salary and a maximum as listed in the following table, provided a <em>General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement</em> is executed. Severance is not payable until the expiration of any revocation period in the <em>General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement</em>.</p>

                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">Senior Staff may continue their university medical insurance and receive the university's regular contributions for three months after the date of termination, provided the employee signs the <em>General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement</em> and (1)</span>&nbsp;timely elects COBRA and completes the necessary medical coverage selection forms, and (2) timely pays any contributions required of the employee. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">Stanford Contributory Retirement Plan (SCRP) Basic contributions continue during the notice period, including any period of pay in lieu of notice. If the Senior Staff member makes employee contributions to the plan during the notice period, matching contributions will also continue.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Policy on Repayment of Severance Pay</strong><br> The months following the termination date comprise the "severance repayment period." This period is equal to the number of months of severance pay received. If a Senior Staff employee is reemployed by the university before the end of the severance repayment period, that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay they would have earned if not terminated may be retained by the employee. The balance&nbsp;of the severance pay is to be repaid in full at the time of reemployment, unless the employee authorizes and the university approves a reasonable schedule of repayment and payroll deduction, not to exceed one year in length, in writing on a form provided by University Human Resources - Employee &amp; Labor Relations.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Policy on Outplacement Services</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.75pt;">Senior Staff whose employment terminates due to permanent layoff will be eligible for three months of outplacement services to be used within six months of the date the employee receives written notification of their layoff. The outplacement services shall be provided by an outplacement agency designated by the university, in its sole discretion, and the cost for such services shall be borne by the university in an amount to be determined from time to time, with additional amounts, if any, to be paid by the department from which the employee was laid off and approved by the Vice President of Human Resources (or designee).</p>

                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Discussion with Supervisor</strong><br> The Senior Staff employee should first discuss the issue with their immediate supervisor. The supervisor should respond orally or in writing as expeditiously as possible, but no longer than one week.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Written Statement</strong><br> If the issue is not resolved by this discussion, the Senior Staff employee may present their concern in writing to the cognizant Dean, Vice President, Vice Provost, or Provost within one week. The Dean, Vice President, Vice Provost, Provost or their designee shall consider the issue, make whatever disposition they deem appropriate, and respond to the employee in writing within two weeks.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Appeal</strong><br> The determination of the Dean, Vice President, Vice Provost, or Provost shall be final except in circumstances where they had direct and immediate involvement in the decision that gave rise to the complaint in the first instance.

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Length of Trial Period</strong><br> The trial period is an employee's first 12 months of service as a regular employee with the university, including service as a trainee.</p> 
                   <p>The trial period is extended for the duration of any approved leave of absence. No other extensions of the trial period are permitted.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. </strong><strong>Salary Increases and Bonuses During Trial Period</strong><br> Trial period employees are not eligible for a salary increase based on merit.&nbsp; However, trial period employees may receive equity or retention adjustments, and spot or team bonuses, at any time during their trial period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Additional Trial Periods</strong><br> An employee who has completed a trial period <strong><em>does not</em></strong> serve an additional trial period when transferred, promoted, or assigned to different duties within the university. However, employees who have been rehired must serve a new trial period, including those employees whose original hire date is reinstated pursuant to <a href="/2-1-2">Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting &amp; Hiring of Regular Staff</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Completion of Trial Period</strong><br> The department should notify the employee by the last day of the trial period that the trial period has been completed or extended due to an approved leave of absence.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Layoff Trial Period</strong><br> An employee will serve a layoff trial period for the initial six months in a new position when:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Hired into another position within one year following the effective date of permanent layoff, or</li> 
                    <li>Hired into another position following formal notification of permanent layoff and prior to the layoff effective date.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>If the employee does not complete the layoff trial period successfully, then the employee may revert to layoff status and receive any benefits that may accrue to that status. Reversion to layoff during the layoff trial period may be invoked either by the employee or by the department.</p> 
                   <p>An employee may serve only one layoff trial period following any one layoff, and may invoke the option to revert to layoff status only once. If hired into a second job (either a subsequent or a simultaneous job), the employee does not serve a layoff trial period. Extension of layoff trial period or completion of layoff trial period is handled as described for the trial period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.</strong> <strong>Termination During Trial Period or Layoff Trial Period</strong><br> The provisions of <a href="/2-1-16">Guide Memo 2.1.16</a><a href="/2-1-16">:&nbsp;Addressing Conduct &amp; Performance Issues</a> do not apply. During the trial period, the employment relationship between the employee and the university is "at-will." This means that employment can be terminated by either the employee or the university at any time and for any reason, or no reason, with or without notice.</p> 
                   <p>The Vice President for Human Resources or his/her designee must approve such terminations.</p>

                   <p>It is the policy of the University that employees are expected to carry out their assigned tasks and responsibilities as instructed and to conduct themselves in accordance with reasonable rules and expectations for the work place. University policy is: Employees cannot be terminated without some form of cause. "Cause" is defined broadly as any legitimate business reason, including but not limited to: Failure to satisfactorily perform job duties or meet job requirements, unavailability for work, excessive absences or tardiness, disclosure or misuse of confidential information, damage or misuse of University property, insubordination, failure to follow University policies and procedures, failure to return from an approved leave, failure or refusal to fully cooperate with a university investigation and/or request for information, unsatisfactory conduct or any other conduct or acts detrimental to or that disrupt the reputation or operations of the University.</p> 
                   <p>Written corrective action and involuntary termination is subject to <a href="/2-1-11">Guide Memo 2.1.11</a>: Staff Grievance Policy.</p> 
                   <p>Corrective action is taken when an employee has not conformed to performance or conduct expectations. University policy does not require corrective action be taken in any formal steps or order, and recognizes that the determination of appropriate corrective action will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. Moreover, some forms of conduct, including any form of gross misconduct, warrant immediate termination.</p>

                   <p><strong>b. Notice</strong><br> Supervisors are normally required to give written notice (e.g., memo, performance evaluation, letter, etc.) that performance or behavior is unsatisfactory and improvement is needed before terminating an employee. Such notice may or may not be preceded by verbal coaching. However, prior notice is not necessary in cases where immediate termination is appropriate (please consult with local Human Resources office).</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Discharge</strong><br> As mentioned in section 3.b, supervisors are normally required to provide notice to an employee of performance deficiencies before termination. However, there is no requirement that notice be provided before termination of employment in all cases. A supervisor must consult with the local Human Resources office before the decision to discharge an employee, and cannot finalize the discharge decision without the concurrence of their next level manager and review and approval by the Office of the Vice President for Human Resources, or their designee.</p>

                      <li><strong>Deferral of Layoff</strong>: A regular staff employee who is notified of layoff but has not yet been laid off and who subsequently accepts work that is anticipated to last less than six months will have their layoff date deferred to the end of the temporary assignment.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">Work can be within the same department or a different department.&nbsp;</span>Layoff deferrals must be approved by University Human Resources - Employee &amp; Labor Relations.<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span>A letter deferring the layoff must be issued to the employee with the new layoff date. Each layoff can be deferred one time only. If the employee resigns after notification of the deferral, they can receive severance pay, which will be recalculated to reflect the last day of employment. Severance pay is based on the employee’s rate of pay and percentage of full time in the position from which they were laid off.</li> 
                      <li><strong>Rescission of Layoff</strong>: A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off and subsequently is retained by the department either in the same, or a substantially equivalent, regular, benefits-eligible position, will have their layoff rescinded. Under these circumstances, the department shall give written notice to the employee that their layoff has been rescinded, after which the employee is no longer in "layoff status," and will not receive severance pay if they resign. An employee who resigns after receiving a letter of layoff rescission will be considered a "voluntary resignation," unless the employee has received a new notice of layoff. For any future staff reductions, the department should follow the normal notice and layoff procedures of this Guide Memo.</li> 
                      <li><strong>Rehire in a Different Department: </strong>A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off and subsequently is hired by any Stanford University department in a regular, benefits-eligible position will not receive severance pay. The position selected for layoff will still be eliminated or reduced. The employee will serve a layoff trial period as described in <a href="/2-1-15">Guide Memo 2.1.15: Trial Period</a>.</li>

                    <li><strong>Medical Plan Coverage</strong>: Stanford will continue its contribution to a laid off employee's medical plan for the employee and their enrolled dependents during the first three months after layoff, provided the employee&nbsp;signs the <em>General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement</em> and (1) timely elects COBRA and<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">&nbsp;</span>completes the necessary medical coverage selection and (2) timely pays any contributions required of the employee. The laid off employee is required to pay the full cost of the plan coverage, plus the administrative fee for coverage after the first three months of COBRA coverage. For temporary or seasonal layoffs, the university will make contributions&nbsp;to the employee’s medical plan and life insurance plan, subject to prompt payment of any required contributions by the employee&nbsp;during the layoff period (up to six months).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Dental and Vision Coverage</strong>: The laid off employee pays the full cost of COBRA coverage, plus administrative fees, for dental and vision, beginning with the first day of COBRA eligibility. The university makes no contribution.</li>

During temporary or seasonal layoff, vacation and sick leave accrue as if the employee were continuing to work regular time (please see <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations</a> and <a href="/2-1-7">Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: <span>Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians</span></a>).&nbsp;The employee may use accumulated vacation, PTO, and floating holiday during temporary or seasonal layoff.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Floating Holiday/Personal Time Off</strong>: A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off will have floating holiday hours and personal time off made available on January 1 in accordance with <a href="/2-1-13">Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays</a> and <a href="/2-1-8">Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences</a>, unless the employee is on terminal vacation.</li>

When the employee is on <strong>a temporary or seasonal layoff</strong> period not exceeding 25 calendar days, regular holiday pay for the employee's normally scheduled number of hours will be paid upon the employee's return to work; see <a href="/2-1-13">Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays</a>.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Outplacement Services</strong>: Regular staff employees whose employment terminates due to permanent layoff will be eligible for three months of outplacement services to commence within six months of the date the employee receives written notification of their layoff. The outplacement services shall be provided by an outplacement agency designated by the university, in its sole discretion, and the cost for such services shall be borne by the university in an amount to be determined from time to time, with additional amounts, if any, to be paid by the department from which the employee was laid off and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Employees Who Are Concurrently Notified of Layoff from the University and Offered a Position at Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital:</strong> A regular staff employee who concurrently receives notification from the university of a permanent layoff and an offer of employment with Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, and who accepts such offer of employment is not eligible for the severance pay, COBRA contributions or other layoff benefits described in Sections 4 and 6.</li>

                    <li>When management deems that the performance, knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees necessary to meet the current and prospective operational and performance requirements are substantially equal, then length of continuous employment with the university and the university's affirmative action commitments will be considered in selecting employees for layoff, reassignment, or retention.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Failure to Return to Work: </strong>If an employee on temporary or seasonal layoff fails to return to work when scheduled to return to work or when recalled to work, the employee shall be deemed to have resigned unless an additional leave of absence is requested and approved in advance of the return date.

This period is equal to the number of months of severance pay received. If an employee is reemployed by the university as a regular benefits-eligible employee before the end of the severance repayment period, that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay they would have earned if not terminated may be retained by the employee.&nbsp;Severance repayment will be prorated for an employee rehired into a position with a lower percentage time commitment or lower rate of pay than the position from which the employee was laid off.&nbsp;The balance of the severance pay is to be repaid in full at the time of reemployment, unless the employee authorizes and the university approves a reasonable schedule of repayment and payroll deduction, not to exceed one year in length, in writing on a form provided by University Human Resources - Employee &amp; Labor Relations.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>An employee may request other arrangements, and if approved, the schedule of repayment will be established by written agreement between the employee and the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee).

                   <p>2. <strong>Effect of Terminal Vacation on Severance Repayment</strong>: If the laid off employee elects to take terminal vacation as described in <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations</a>, the new layoff effective date will be the last day of the terminal vacation period. The severance repayment period begins on the first business day following the layoff effective date.

                   <p>For example, if an employee has used 12 weeks of FMLA/CFRA leave for the birth of a child, the employee is not entitled to an additional 12 weeks of leave within that 12-month period to deal with exigent circumstances arising from a family member's call to active duty. But, the employee would be entitled to up to another 12 weeks (for a total of 26 weeks combined) to care for a covered family member who is injured in the line of duty.</p>

                   <p>Relocation allowances should be offered only when the University feels that payment of part or all of relocation expenses is a significant factor in being able to attract a potential employee to Stanford, or in being able to attract an employee to accept a temporary reassignment.

                    <li>Current full-time employees temporarily reassigned to a location 50 or more miles away. If such a reassignment is for less than a year, it is a Stanford business expense and not tax-reportable. Travel rules apply; see <a href="/5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses.

                   <p><strong>a. Policy</strong><br> All or part of the expenses associated with a trip to Stanford for the purpose of house-hunting may be reimbursed to a prospective employee. Generally these may include those expenses reimbursable for travel by University employees (see <a href="/5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses), except that the per diem method may not be used. However, the <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/reimburse/res_jobaid/per_diem_rates.html">Per Diem Rates</a> may be used as a guideline for defining reasonable costs.</p> 
                   <p>In addition, the vice president, vice provost, dean or designee may authorize the following:</p>

                   <p><strong>b. Procedure </strong>— In any instance where house-hunting trip expenses are to be reimbursed by the University, the cognizant University officer should specify in writing to the prospective employee the terms and conditions of the reimbursement, including a maximum dollar amount to be reimbursed. It is the responsibility of the department issuing the reimbursement request to be sure it complies with the letter of authorization. Receipts must be submitted for expenses, as required in <a href="/5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses, section 14.</p>

Limited assignments are for one calendar year or less and presuppose no change in permanent residence nor primary affiliation with another organization. All travel expense policies of the University (<a href="/5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses) apply to limited assignments, with these points of clarification:</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Expenses are reimbursable </strong>only to the extent authorized in a formal letter of authorization (invitation). Transportation expenses for dependents may be allowed at the discretion of the vice president, vice provost, dean or designee, but will not be allowed for an assignment of fewer than 30 days.</p>

                   <p><strong>d. Reimbursement</strong><br> The University will not reimburse expenses except those specifically detailed in the letter of authorization. Expenses reimbursed by other sources may not be included in the reimbursement request.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Lodging</strong><br> While a person is seeking longer term suitable housing, payment by the University of actual and reasonable short term lodging costs or a per diem reimbursement is allowed, consistent with section 5 (En Route/Travel Expenses) of this Guide Memo. After suitable housing is obtained, a lodging allowance may be authorized if deemed necessary. A lodging allowance may be necessary if the employee has actual expenses greater than those incurred living in his/her primary residence. Any income from renting the primary residence while on temporary assignment must be considered in the lodging reimbursement calculation.</p>

                    <li>“Stanford Campus” means the primary campus in Stanford, CA.</li> 
                    <li>“Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford Campus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple regions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford Research Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.</li> 
                    <li>“Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford Campus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated work space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office environment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.</li> 
                    <li>“Stanford Work Location” includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite.</li> 
                    <li>“Primary Stanford Work Location” means the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite designated by Stanford as the primary location available to the employee to perform their work.</li> 
                    <li>“Hybrid” means a role that the university determines is suitable to be performed to some varying extent off-site and for which a Stanford employee requests and is approved by Stanford to work in different work locations (e.g., mix of Primary Stanford Work Location and their home or other location). Individuals in a Hybrid work arrangement have a Primary Stanford Work Location designated by the university. Hybrid roles require a regular presence at the employee's Primary Stanford Work Location. Required regular presence is determined by the employee’s department or unit and is typically two, three, or four days per week or an equivalent amount of time monthly. Managers are generally expected to arrange their in-person work so there is adequate staffing on-site. Managers who believe their operational needs warrant a regular cadence for hybrid that is less than an average of two days per week or less than a similar amount of time monthly, should discuss this with their Dean, Vice Provost, or Vice President (or their delegate) as well as the local senior HR Manager to obtain approval.</li> 
                    <li>“Telecommute” or “telecommuting” means performing Stanford work on a regular, part-time basis as part of a Hybrid work arrangement from a location other than the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location, provided the location is not a Stanford Work Location.</li>

                    <li>At all times, employees in a Hybrid work arrangement will have access to a fully equipped workspace at their Primary Stanford Work Location. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are not required to telecommute. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement can choose to work at their Primary Stanford Work Location on any regularly scheduled day, including on days when they would normally telecommute.</li> 
                    <li>Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to remain available and accessible during regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the department. Employees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person, including on days they would customarily telecommute if in a Hybrid work arrangement.</li> 
                    <li>Hybrid work arrangements for non-exempt employees can only include full workdays on-site or at their telecommuting worksite. Non-exempt employees are required to strictly adhere to required rest and meal breaks, and to accurately report their work hours as set forth in <a href="http://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees</a>. Non-exempt employees must obtain prior approval before working any overtime.</li> 
                    <li>Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to make dependent care arrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.</li> 
                    <li>For approved Hybrid work arrangements, travel between an employee’s telecommuting worksite and their Primary Stanford Work Location is considered part of an employee’s normal commute and associated expenses are not reimbursable. Employees who have requested and been approved to be Hybrid are not entitled to reimbursement for travel to a Stanford Work Location because the employee has requested a more flexible work arrangement even though a workspace at a Stanford Work Location is available on a daily basis.</li> 
                    <li>Employees who are approved to work a Hybrid work arrangement must sign the Hybrid Work Agreement, and any other documents the department or university may require. The Hybrid Work Agreement should be reviewed and renewed by the manager and employee periodically but no less frequently than annually.</li> 
                    <li>HR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved Hybrid work arrangement have a Hybrid Work Agreement that complies with this policy and is signed by the employee, manager and HR Manager. In addition, HR Managers or their delegates must keep the HR information system up-to-date with the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location and the location from which the employee in a Hybrid work arrangement telecommutes. Such records must also include the frequency and duration of the Hybrid work arrangement.</li> 
                    <li>Hybrid work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any time at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable notice, typically two (2) weeks.</li>

                    <li>Employees approved to telecommute as part of a Hybrid work arrangement are responsible to ensure that their telecommuting worksite is ergonomically appropriate. Employees who do not have or are not able to provide themselves an ergonomically appropriate place to work should not telecommute under a Hybrid work arrangement and should work instead at their Primary Stanford Work Location.</li> 
                    <li>Employees working in approved Hybrid work arrangements are eligible to purchase or be reimbursed up to $250 for basic necessary ergonomic equipment for their telecommuting worksite <em>only</em>to the extent such equipment is recommended by Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&amp;S) following an ergonomic assessment. Reimbursement of expenses or the purchase of the equipment by the department will occur <em>only after</em> the employee completes <em>all</em> required steps outlined in the <a href="https://ehs.stanford.edu/topic/ergonomics">Stanford Ergonomics Program</a> available on the EH&amp;S website at <a href="http://ehs.stanford.edu/">ehs.stanford.edu</a>.

                    <li>Since the university provides a fully-equipped Primary Stanford Work Location for employees in Hybrid work arrangements, it generally does not provide reimbursement for cell phone or home Internet connectivity unless there is a demonstrated business necessity.

                   <p>The workplace culture at Stanford is one that is rooted in collaboration, continuous discourse about planned work and projects underway, and in providing stellar service to our university community. With appropriate use of technology and managerial oversight, staff whose roles allow for all work to be performed at a location that is not a Stanford location may be eligible for a Remote work arrangement.

                    <li>“Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford Campus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple regions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford Research Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.</li> 
                    <li>“Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford Campus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated work space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office environment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.</li> 
                    <li>"Stanford Work Location" includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite.</li>

                    <li>“Remote” means a role in which a Stanford employee is approved or designated by Stanford to work from home or at a site other than a Stanford Work Location and the employee is not required to have a regular presence on-site to perform their duties as outlined under a hybrid work arrangement (defined in <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-20">Guide Memo 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements</a>). This also includes an employee who is approved or designated by Stanford to telecommute on a full-time but temporary basis (more than 4 consecutive weeks) from a location other than the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location or other Stanford Work Location. Although Remote employees may be required to come to a Stanford Work Location infrequently or on limited occasions (e.g., generally no more than a few days total each quarter), this would not change their Remote status.</li>

                    <li>Some departments may have work conducive to hiring Remote staff. When considering whether a Remote work arrangement is appropriate, managers should take into consideration, among other factors, the nature of the work, costs described in Section 4 below, whether the department can maintain the quality and effectiveness of their services to members of the university community with an employee working in a Remote role, and whether the work should or must be performed remotely.</li> 
                    <li>When an existing employee wishes to transition to work remotely, managers should take into consideration applicable factors listed above, performance and productivity of the employee, and the ability of the employee to work independently.</li> 
                    <li>Decisions about the suitability of Remote work arrangements are discretionary and require approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee as well as the local senior HR Manager.</li>

                   <ol> 
                    <li>Employees in a Remote work arrangement must comply with all Stanford policies and procedures, including the appropriate handling of confidential information.</li> 
                    <li>Employees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to remain available and accessible during regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the department. Employees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person.</li> 
                    <li>Non-exempt employees are required to strictly adhere to required rest and meal breaks, and to accurately report their work hours as set forth in&nbsp;<a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees</a>. Non-exempt employees must obtain prior approval before working any overtime.</li> 
                    <li>Employees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to make dependent care arrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.</li> 
                    <li>Remote employees are paid competitive rates based on the geographic region where they work. To ensure consistent, equitable application of our compensation program, University Human Resources--Staff Compensation will work in partnership with local HR Managers to review and approve the compensation of all employees in Remote work arrangements, including newly hired employees, employees transitioning into an approved Remote work arrangement, and employees who move and change their Remote work location.&nbsp; The university may adjust salary rates for employees who transition into a Remote work arrangement or who move and change their Remote work location consistent with the foregoing. Employees in Remote work arrangements must obtain approval in advance from the department and the local senior HR Manager, and inform Stanford Benefits if they plan to move their Remote work location to a different city or state. In addition, the department should review the provisions of <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-2/policy-2-2-2">Guide Memo 2.2.2</a><a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-2/policy-2-2-2">: Out-of-State Employees</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/admin_outStateEE.html">Fingate</a> with respect to out-of-state payroll for Remote employees working in the U.S. but outside of California.</li> 
                    <li>For Remote employees whose residence is within a 10-county&nbsp;area*, travel to a Stanford Work Location will not be reimbursed because the remote arrangement is at the employee’s request and there is space available for the employee to work on campus. For other Remote employees, Stanford will reimburse expenses for occasional, required travel to a Stanford Work Location as long as the travel is necessarily incurred and the employee receives prior approval by the employee’s department/manager. 
                     <div>
                      *The 10-county area&nbsp;includes all of the following counties: Santa Clara County, San Mateo County, San Francisco County, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Marin County, Napa County, Sonoma County, Solano County, or Santa Cruz County.
                     </div> </li> 
                    <li>Remote employees must be provided with appropriate reimbursement for required and approved Stanford-related business travel, in accordance with Stanford’s travel reimbursement policies.</li> 
                    <li>Remote work arrangements must be approved by the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department as well as the local senior HR Manager. Employees who are approved for a Remote work arrangement must sign the Remote Work Agreement, and any other documents the department or university may require. The Remote Work Agreement should be reviewed and renewed by the manager and employee periodically but no less frequently than annually.</li> 
                    <li>HR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved Remote work arrangement have a Remote Work Agreement that complies with this policy and is signed by the employee, manager, local senior HR Manager and the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department. In addition, HR Managers or their delegates must keep the HR information system up-to-date with the location from which the employee works. Such records must also include the duration of the Remote work arrangement.</li> 
                    <li>Remote employees must obtain approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department, or their designee, as well as the local senior HR Manager if they wish to relocate their remote workspace to a different city, state and/or country, prior to such relocation.</li> 
                    <li>Remote work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any time at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable notice, typically four (4) weeks. In such an event, the department may consider offering the Remote employee the opportunity to work at a Stanford Work Location that the department deems appropriate, but is under no obligation to do so. Nothing in this Administrative Guide Memo requires the department to retain a Remote employee whom the department would otherwise terminate or lay off, consistent with university policies.</li>

                    <li>Generally, the university does not maintain an equipped workspace at a Stanford Work Location for Remote employees. Accordingly, departments are required to provide reasonable reimbursement for and/or supply the equipment, services and supplies deemed by the university to be reasonable and necessary to enable Remote employees to perform their Stanford work, all in accordance with Stanford’s policies governing reimbursement of business expenses. Employees in Remote work arrangements will be provided with a one-time taxable payment of $750 to purchase basic home office equipment to ensure a productive and safe home work environment.

                    <li>Employees approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote work arrangement are responsible to ensure that their remote workspace is ergonomically appropriate by completing an ergonomic assessment through EH&amp;S.

                    <li>Employees who are approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote work arrangement are responsible to ensure their remote workspace is equipped with adequate internet connectivity to perform their work, including video conferencing.</li> 
                    <li>Employees in Remote work arrangements are eligible for a stipend for cell phone and/or home Internet connectivity as outlined in <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-8/subchapter-1/policy-8-1-3">Guide Memo 8.1.3: Provision of Mobile Equipment and Related Services</a>. &nbsp;</li>

Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick days is limited to 24 hours or three (3) scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a contingent employee has during scheduled work hours.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Sick time may be used for the following reasons:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;"><strong>a. Absence Due to Illness or Injury</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">Sick time may be used when a contingent employee’s illness or injury prevents the contingent employee from working.</p> 
                   <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. </strong><strong>Medical and Dental Appointments</strong></p> 
                   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including:&nbsp;</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition</li> 
                    <li>Preventative care</li> 
                    <li>Those appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; c.</strong> <strong>Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">Sick time may be used by a contingent employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking in order to:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Obtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or his or her child</li> 
                    <li>Seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Family Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">Contingent employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a contingent employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes only the contingent employee's:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Spouse or registered domestic partner</li> 
                    <li>Children of the contingent employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the contingent employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or dependency status)</li> 
                    <li>Parents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a contingent employee or the contingent employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the contingent employee was a minor)</li> 
                    <li>Brothers and sisters</li> 
                    <li>Grandparents or grandchildren</li> 
                    <li>Other family member dependent on the contingent employee and living in the contingent employee's household</li> 
                   </ul>

                 <div class="policy-subsection-container policy-subection-container-24689">
                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="administration"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Administration</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Notification of Absence</strong></p> 
                   <p>The contingent employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how contingent employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the contingent employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the contingent employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a contingent employee has accrued sick time available and has not reached applicable limits of sick time use per year of employment, a request to use sick time should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use. Contingent employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules work for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a contingent employee’s work hours.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use</strong></p> 
                   <p>The University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used, and accumulated for all contingent employees. Contingent employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. The use of sick time is limited to 24 hours (or three scheduled workdays, whichever is greater) during each year of employment. Up to 24 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a contingent employee has three scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 24 hours, the contingent employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources Office. Contingent employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. (For information about Axess, see the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html" target="_blank">Time &amp; Leave System overview</a>.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Sick Time Credit Date</strong></p> 
                   <p>Sick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a contingent employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the contingent employee should speak to the local Human Resources Office for assistance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Tax Status</strong></p> 
                   <p>Sick time is taxable income. Federal, state and FICA taxes are deducted.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Medical Confirmation</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>(1)&nbsp;Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Acceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a contingent employee’s use of the first 24 hours of sick time (or three scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a contingent employee’s failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>(2)&nbsp;Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the University has reasonable basis to believe that a contingent employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 24 hours or three scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a contingent employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:25.0pt;"><strong>(3)&nbsp;Acceptable Medical Evidence</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Acceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner’s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the contingent employee is released to return to work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Sources of Funds for Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p>As sick time is used to replace scheduled work hours, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Applicable Laws</strong></p> 
                   <p>The intent of this Guide Memo 2.1.22 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522.</p>

                    A Stanford postdoctoral scholar is a non-matriculated trainee, in graduate student status, in residence at Stanford University pursuing advanced studies beyond the doctoral level in preparation for an independent career. Postdoctoral Scholars are appointed for a limited period of time and may participate on Stanford research projects and/or may be supported by external awards or fellowships. In all cases, their appointment at Stanford is for the purpose of advanced studies, research, and training under the mentorship of a Stanford faculty member.

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> If duties are technical, maintenance, or service, employees may be appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than four consecutive months.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. </strong>Temporary and casual employees are not regular employees. Temporary or casual employees are considered "at-will” for the duration of their employment. This means that employment can be terminated by either the employee or the university at any time and for any reason, or no reason, with or without notice.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. </strong>An individual may be hired in a regular benefits-eligible position at any time after reaching the 980-hour maximum, as long as he/she meets all employment requirements. Admin Guide Memo<a href="/2-1-2"> 2.1.2</a>:&nbsp;Recruiting and Hiring of Regular Staff, outlines information about employment preference provided to temporary or casual staff.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Applicable laws</strong><br> Employees outside the state of California and Stanford University as their employer are subject to all employment-related laws of the state or foreign nation in which they work.</p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">State taxes, employment tax, and workers compensation provisions vary from state to state. University&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Payroll is primarily responsible for compliance with these various rules. Therefore, departments must&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">notify Payroll immediately of any prospective arrangements involving Stanford employees outside the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">state of California by submitting a<a href="http://helpsu.stanford.edu"> HelpSU </a>ticket&nbsp;(Category: Financial&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Management, Request Type: Payroll).</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The existence of Stanford University employees in a state outside California may trigger&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">additional compliance requirements besides those relating to employment. Therefore, the hiring&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">or reassignment of employees to positions outside California must be supported by an important&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">University business purpose and not be merely an accommodation to the employee.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Approval</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Approval of the hire or reassignment must be obtained in advance in writing from the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">person within the organizational unit), or his/her designee, identifying the key University business&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">reasons for the assignment.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Payroll</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Notify University Payroll of the out-of-state assignment in advance of the start of&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">work outside of California by sending a completed Approval of <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/approval_out_state_hire.pdf">Out-of-State Employee&nbsp;</a></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/approval_out_state_hire.pdf">Approval form </a>to the Payroll Office.&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Administrative costs</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Administrative costs per capita for out-of-state employees are high due to the extraordinary costs&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">to assure compliance and, in some cases, liability for unemployment and disability benefits.&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Therefore, a one-time $500 fee is charged to the assigning department for each new out-of-state&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">employee on payroll, to be assessed when the assignment begins. Departments are also charged&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">$200 each year for each out-of-state employee. Failure to report out-of-state employees to&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">University Payroll in a timely manner may result in compliance penalties, which will be assessed&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">to the assigning department.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Benefits</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The choices of health and welfare benefits plans may be more limited for employees&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">who work outside of the Bay Area. You can find more information at&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards">https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards</a>.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>f. When Employee Works in California</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Notify University Payroll of any days that the out-of&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">state employee is present in California on Stanford business. Compensation earned on such days is&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">considered California-sourced taxable income regardless of employee’s state of residence and is&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">subject to all California tax provisions. Use the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/days_worked_CA.pdf">Out-of-State Employee Days Worked in California&nbsp;</a></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/days_worked_CA.pdf">form</a> to report annually the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">number of days an out-of-state worker works in California.</span></p>

                   <p>Whether an individual is a university employee or an independent contractor is a determination with important practical and legal consequences.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. General Rule</strong><br> Federal tax rules define an employee as an individual who performs services subject to control by an employer both as to what services shall be performed and how they shall be performed. If the university has the legal right to control both the method and result of services, that person is considered an employee and therefore subject to income tax withholding.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Questions on Employee or Independent Contractor Status</strong><br> In cases of doubt about an individual's status, contact Human Resources or Procurement/Special Contracts for advice.

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="employment-categories"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Employment Categories</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Employees are categorized within the payroll system according to the length of the appointment, the percentage of time worked, and the type of position they fill. These categories in combination affect eligibility for most employment benefits.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Length of Appointment</strong><br> (1) Continuing<br> Continuing employees are expected to remain on the payroll for six months or more (four months or more for Bargaining Unit employees).<br> (2) Temporary<br> Temporary employees are expected to remain on the payroll for less than six months (less than four months for Bargaining Unit employees). Stanford students working less than 50% time may be appointed for the entire academic year as temporary employees. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Scope of Appointment</strong><br> The percentage of a full-time equivalent position (% FTE) an employee works affects both eligibility and level of benefits. See <a href="/2-2-1">Guide Memo 2.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Definitions, for the % FTE of a continuing appointment that grants "regular employee" status and eligibility for most benefit plans and programs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Type of Position</strong><br> The job classification defines whether the position is:<br> <strong>(1) Salaried or Hourly-Paid</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Salaried employees are paid their semi-monthly salary (less authorized deductions) every pay period unless an exception (such as authorized overtime hours or leave without pay) is reported. Subject to exceptions, the gross salary amount of the paycheck is the same for each pay period, regardless of the number of working days in the period.</li> 
                    <li>Hourly-paid employees are paid for actual hours worked (less authorized deductions) as shown on a timecard submitted for the pay period.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Exempt or Non-exempt</strong><br> See the definitions in <a href="/2-2-1">Guide Memo 2.2.1</a>.&nbsp;Employees who are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act are not paid overtime.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Documentation of Eligibility for Employment</strong><br> <strong>(1) Completing Form I-9</strong><br> All new and rehired employees must complete a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9 by the end of the day on their first day of (re) employment, and provide appropriate original document(s) to establish identity and work authorization. The hiring department, or other university designee, must review the original document(s) and complete the employer portion of this form within three business days of the first day of employment. Employers cannot specify which document(s) the employee must present. Completed forms are submitted to Payroll for review and document retention.<br> <strong>(2) Updating Form I-9</strong><br> Eligibility to work in the U.S. may expire for certain types of temporary visitors. Documentation of continued eligibility to work must be provided before the work eligibility expiration date.<br> <strong>(3) Re-verifying Form I-9</strong><br> A new or re-verified Form I-9 must be completed after any break in employment. Students who are continuously employed, except during normal school break periods, are not subject to the re-verification requirement.<br> <strong>(4) Failure to Complete/Update Form I-9</strong><br> Failure to comply with USCIS Form I-9 requirements will result in ineligibility for employment and/or immediate termination.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Tax Requirements</strong><br> <strong>(1) Withholding Tax Information</strong><br> New employees must complete a withholding declaration at hire. In the absence of a completed withholding declaration, withholding tax will be applied as if the employee had claimed "Single" status with no withholding allowances on their W-4 and DE-4.<br> <strong>(2) Tax Treaties</strong><br> Some employees who are not residents of the U.S. may qualify for full or partial exemption from withholding tax based on tax treaties between the U.S. and their country of tax residence. Texts of most treaties (in both English and the language of the other country) are available from the <a href="http://irs.gov" target="_blank">IRS website</a>. For more information and to obtain the necessary documents to claim a tax treaty, see <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/students/taxinfo/quick_steps/claim_taxTreaty_salary.html">How to: Claim Tax Treaty for Salary Payments</a>.<br> <strong>(3) Social Security Number</strong><br> A Social Security number is required for all employees working in the U.S. Employees who do not already have a Social Security Number may begin employment, but must immediately apply for a Social Security Number and obtain a receipt of application. Once received, the hiring department must enter the Social Security Number in the PeopleSoft HR system.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Semimonthly Payroll</strong><br> University employees are paid semimonthly. Pay periods are the 1st through 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Salary Approvals</strong><br> Department heads or other authorized university officers approve charges of salaries and wages to their projects, tasks and awards (PTAs) in accordance with budgets, compensation policies and collective bargaining agreements. In addition to the department head, certain offices have responsibility for reviewing salaries and wages for specific categories of employees. Salary changes, supplementary compensation, salary during leave of absence and termination of salary require the same authorization and review. Supervisors (or, in their absence, designees with first-hand knowledge of employees work hours) are responsible for approving employee timecards, including leave usage for exempt and non-exempt employees and work hours for non-exempt employees.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Faculty and Academic Staff: Salaries for faculty and academic staff are reviewed and approved by the cognizant dean and the Provost's Office.</li> 
                    <li>Salaried Staff: Salaries for staff employees are established, reviewed and approved by the cognizant dean, director or equivalent university officer. In some cases, review by Human Resources is also required.</li> 
                    <li>Hourly-paid Staff: Hourly wages are reviewed and approved by Human Resources.</li> 
                    <li>Students: See <a href="https://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/wage_scale.html">Undergraduate Student Wage Scales</a>,<a href="/10-2-1">&nbsp;Guide Memo 10.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Graduate Student Assistantships, and the <a href="https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary18/index.html">Graduate Student Assistantship Supplement</a>.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Charges to Projects, Tasks and Awards</strong><br> Financial Management Services (FMS) charges salary and wage expenditures to PTAs designated by the department. Charges are reported on monthly expenditure or detail reports. Departmental staff provides the charging instructions through "Labor Schedules" in the Oracle Financials Labor Distribution module. See Fingate for the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/learning/fin-prog-0020-financial-stewardship-expectations">training information and requirements</a> that must be completed to access this system.<br> <strong>(1) Multiple Activities/Accounts</strong><br> If an employee is paid from more than one PTA, the authorized portion of salary or wage is allocated to the appropriate PTA. The paycheck or bank deposit advice delivered to the employee combines all earnings into one check.<br> <strong>(2) Organization Suspense Account</strong><br> Each department designates an unrestricted PTA as an Organization Suspense Account to which salaries of department employees are charged whenever the source of salary funding (such as a grant or contract) runs out and is not immediately replaced by alternative funding. Charges to Organization Suspense Account PTAs, which are charged to the expenditure type 51610, should be reviewed on a timely basis to determine if transfers are needed.

                   <p><strong>a. Taxable Earnings</strong><br> The university withholds Federal, State, and other applicable taxes from all taxable earnings paid to employees. Taxable earnings include regular pay, overtime pay, supplementary compensation and any additional and miscellaneous payments for work performed for the university. This may also include taxable reimbursements. See <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-5/subchapter-4/policy-5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses</a> for additional details on taxable reimbursements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. W-2 Statements</strong><br> At the end of each tax year (January 1 through December 31), Stanford compiles and distributes a W-2 Statement for each employee. As a default, W-2 Statements are mailed to the employee's mailing address on file with the university. Employees may elect to have their W-2 Statement sent to them electronically in the Axess portal. The university also sends Form W-2 data, as required, to Federal and State governments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Tax Exemptions</strong><br> Employees may not claim more withholding allowances than those allowed by the Internal Revenue Service or Franchise Tax Board. Fewer allowances may be claimed or additional dollar amount of taxes may be withheld if an employee wishes to increase the amount of tax withheld.

                   <p><strong>d. Student Employees</strong><br> Students who take jobs with the university while pursuing their studies are paid through the university payroll. Degree-seeking Stanford student employees, who are employed while enrolled in classes, do not pay Social Security taxes or Disability Insurance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Scholarships and Fellowships</strong><br> Scholarship and fellowship payments are not considered payments for work performed and the recipients are not placed in an employer-employee relationship because of receipt of this money from the university.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Research and Teaching Assistants</strong><br> Research and teaching assistantships are taxable, and tax is withheld from the semi-monthly salary.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Non-California Residents</strong><br> All employees who physically work in California are treated as California residents for California tax purposes.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Tax Status of Non-U.S. Residents</strong><br> Salaries and wages paid to non-residents of the U.S. fall under the tax laws of the United States and the State of California. The specific provisions of the tax laws, treaties, conventions, and determinations in regard to non-residents are handled by the Internal Revenue Service and the California Franchise Tax Board.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Deductions for Benefits</strong><br> Employees eligible for benefits (e.g., regular staff, faculty) may pay the employee's share of the cost of some insurance programs and benefits by payroll deduction. For more information, go to the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/health" target="_blank">Cardinal at Work website</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Other Authorized Deduction</strong>s<br> The university has authorized voluntary payroll deductions for payments to certain organizations (such as the Stanford Faculty Club). Any employee who wishes to use this procedure should make arrangements directly with the organization for which the deduction is authorized. That organization will send the authorization to Payroll.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Reporting Deductions</strong><br> Deductions from each paycheck are itemized on the pay statement. The amounts deducted are sent to the designated organizations.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Cessation of Deductions</strong><br> <strong>(1) Benefits</strong><br> Payroll deductions for benefits cease during leaves of absence without pay. An employee on leave without pay will receive information from the university's leave administrator on how to pay for the employee's share of the costs for applicable insurance plans. Benefit deductions also stop when an employee's status changes to a non-benefits-eligible position (see <a href="/2-2-1">Guide Memo 2.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Definitions) and when employment terminates. At that time, terminated employees may call Stanford Benefits at (650) 736-2985 to determine when they can start the paperwork to receive payment from their retirement savings.<br> <strong>(2) Other Authorized Deductions</strong><br> Payroll deductions arranged through an organization external to Stanford are available to all employees, and are not affected by a change in employment status. Such deductions cease during leaves of absence without pay, at termination of employment, or on retirement.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Direct Deposit of Paychecks</strong><br> Employees are encouraged to have their paychecks deposited directly into their bank accounts. Employees may use any bank, savings and loan or credit union that is a member of the Automated Clearing House and can accept electronic fund transfers. Direct deposit enrollment instructions are available at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/quick_steps/enroll_direct_deposit.html">How to: Enroll/Update/Cancel Direct Deposit</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Delivery of Semi-monthly Paychecks and Advices</strong><br> Pay statements are provided for all employees electronically in the Axess portal. Payroll distributes live paychecks and paper pay statements through interdepartmental mail. Other employees who wish to receive a paper pay statement must select this option in the Axess portal.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Undelivered Checks</strong><br> A paycheck for an absent employee may be held by the department until the employee's return, if the absence is for no longer than one pay period. The department can mail the check if requested by the employee. Checks returned by the Post Office should be forwarded to Payroll for handling. Paychecks issued in error must be returned to Payroll for cancellation and reversal of earnings from employee's W-2.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Stale-Dated Checks</strong><br> Paychecks are negotiable for six months from date of issue. Stale-dated checks should be returned to Payroll for reissue. Funds from checks not cashed after one year from date of issue must be remitted to the State of California Unclaimed Property Bureau.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Delivery of Final Paycheck</strong><br> An individual's final paycheck must include the total amount of salary or wages owed as of the date of termination. This includes all payments due, including accumulated, unused vacation leave, PTO and floating holiday, less authorized deductions. The department should contact Employee &amp; Labor Relations in advance if questions arise.<br> <strong>(1)</strong> If the university initiates the termination, or if the employee initiates the termination and gives at least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck must be given to the employee on the date of termination.<br> <strong>(2) </strong>When an employee initiates the termination and gives less than 72 hours notice, the final paycheck is due to the employee within 72 hours after termination. Departments are responsible for making sure final paychecks are delivered to employees under the time limitations provided by law. A completed <a href="https://stanford.box.com/s/jl4vfwuidqsux0m43i9mhkap7bm87l4v" target="_blank">Termination Transaction</a> must be submitted to Payroll in order to process the final paycheck.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Vacation Payment and Vacation Credit</strong><br> Vacation earned but unused at termination is paid on the basis of the employee’s hourly rate at termination. For salaried employees at 100% FTE, the hourly rate is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year). If an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains his/her accumulated vacation accruals. (See <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations</a>).&nbsp;For more information about the policy on accrual and use of vacation leave, contact Systems &amp; Reporting Operations (SRO) in Financial Management Services (FMS). The Vacation Accrual template found at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/quick_steps/calcuate_vac_accrual.html">How to: Calculate Vacation Accrual </a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">can be used to calculate vacation when an employee terminates.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Partial Pay Period Pay Calculation</strong><br> Pay for less than a full pay period for new or terminating salaried employees is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year) and multiplying that number by the number of days the employee actually worked, including adjacent holidays, in the pay period times 8 (assume 8 hours/day for a full-time exempt employee.) Holidays are counted as workdays when the employee works or is on paid leave (including vacation) both the day immediately preceding and the day following a holiday.</p>

(Find information on salary advances for Bargaining Unit members in the applicable agreement.)<br> <strong>(1) Vacation Advance</strong><br> An employee scheduled to take vacation leave of at least 10 consecutive workdays outside San Francisco Bay Area, may request early payment of any regular paychecks that would be issued during that period.<br> <strong>(2) Emergency Advance</strong><br> Only in an emergency and with the concurrence of his/her department, a regular employee may receive an advance of salary already earned in one pay period prior to the regular payday for that pay period. No more than two emergency advances for the same employee will be processed in a 12-month period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Faculty Terminations</strong><br> A faculty member leaving after completing the employment obligation but before the designated end date of his/her appointment may receive the balance of salary through a special processing procedure. If this option is exercised, the faculty member's status as an employee ends on the termination date. The termination date must not be later than the date of the final check.</p>

                   <p>Stanford University supports the importance of health and bonding for parents nursing their infants. It is the policy of the university to follow all state and federal laws and regulations in this area, including California Labor Code (Sections 1030-1033) and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In promoting a family-friendly work environment and to ensure equality of access for employees who wish to breastfeed, the university will provide reasonable accommodations to enable employees to express breast milk.</p> 
                   <p>Lactation spaces are available to all members of the university community, including students, postdoctoral scholars, and third parties who participate in Stanford programs and activities. The <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/worklife">WorkLife Office</a> maintains a list of campus spaces that may be used for lactation.</p> 
                   <p>All Stanford University affiliated nursing parents, including students and postdoctoral scholars, are encouraged to register for the <a href="https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UWeounCEm48bxH">Stanford Lactation Support Program</a>.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Employees:</strong> are responsible for notifying a supervisor as soon as a lactation accommodation is needed. It is recommended that an employee anticipating an accommodation discuss their needs with their supervisor before a family leave is taken, including the anticipated schedule and request to access an appropriate space. Requests from staff employees should be made to the supervisor or Human Resources Manager. Faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff should contact their Department Chair and departmental faculty affairs officer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Supervisors:</strong> are responsible for receiving requests for a lactation accommodation, and in consultation with the Human Resources Manager, reviewing accommodation requirements, identifying appropriate space and schedule for the employee, and discussing the accommodation with the employee. In the case of faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff, the term ‘supervisor’ in this policy refers to the Department Chair.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Human Resources Managers:</strong> are responsible for advising supervisors of accommodation requirements and assisting supervisors in consultation with the building or facilities managers to identify appropriate space to accommodate the employee. To identify the local Human Resources office, call the appropriate number: Campus 650-721-4272; School of Medicine 650-497-2750; SLAC 650-926-2358.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Department Chairs and Departmental Faculty Affairs Officers: </strong>are responsible for receiving faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff requests for a lactation accommodation and, in consultation with the Human Resources Manager or departmental faculty affairs officer, reviewing accommodation requests and requirements, identifying appropriate space for the employee and discussing the accommodation with the employee.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Step One – Request:</strong> Employees are responsible for initiating the request for a lactation accommodation. The request does not need to be made in writing, nor is a doctor’s note required. The employee should consider discussing a request with their supervisor or Human Resources Manager before taking a family leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Step Two – Discussion:</strong> When received, the supervisor or Human Resources Manager will meet with the employee to acknowledge the request and help develop an accommodation. The supervisor or Human Resources Manager should confirm that the employee has a private, clean and secure place to express breastmilk (see Section 6: Identifying Space). If the employee has questions or concerns about expressing breastmilk at work, questions should be referred to the Human Resources Manager or the WorkLife Office.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Step Three – Follow up:</strong> The supervisor or Human Resources Manager should confirm the accommodation in writing and offer to revisit the plan with the employee after two to three weeks to see if any changes are needed.&nbsp;</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>An accommodation includes a reasonable amount of time taken as needed by the employee to express breastmilk in a space that complies with state and federal requirements (see Section 6: Identifying Space). When possible, time should be taken during regularly scheduled meal and rest periods. The number of breaks needed to express breastmilk may vary. A nursing parent will typically need two or three breaks during an eight-hour period; however, additional break times may be necessary. If the time to express breastmilk exceeds an employee’s regularly-scheduled meal or rest periods, non-exempt employees may request to be provided an opportunity to make up time per <a href="/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-5">Admin Guide Memo 2.1.5</a>. If no reasonable opportunity exists for a non-exempt employee to make up time, the time to express breastmilk that exceeds paid rest periods will not be paid. The break schedule should be based on the employee’s needs and the operational needs of the department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>If an employee, who is otherwise entitled to rest breaks or meal periods under <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-5">Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees</a>, Sections 2.e-f, is not provided reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk, a penalty of one hour of the employee's straight time hourly rate must be paid to the employee each day there is such a violation. Any employee who believes they have not been provided with reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk should immediately report their concerns to their local Human Resources office or University Human Resources/Employee &amp; Labor Relations. Employees may also pursue complaints directly with the California Labor Commissioner's Office.</p>

Space may be identified at an adjacent building within a reasonable walking distance and that is accessible to the employee during the arranged lactation schedule. A reasonable distance is recommended as no more than a 5-minute walk from the employee’s building. For multi-use spaces, the use of the room for lactation will take precedence over other uses during the time it is used for lactation.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Smoking-Prohibited Areas</strong><br> Specifically, smoking is prohibited in classrooms and offices, all enclosed buildings and facilities, in covered walkways, in University vehicles, during indoor or outdoor athletic events, during other University sponsored or designated indoor or outdoor events and in outdoor areas designated by signage as "smoking prohibited" areas.</p> 
                   <ul>

                   <p><strong>b. Outdoor Smoking Areas</strong><br> Except where otherwise posted as a "smoking prohibited area," smoking is generally permitted in outdoor areas, except during organized events. Outdoor smoking in non-prohibited areas must be at least 30 feet away from doorways, open windows, covered walkways, and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from entering enclosed buildings and facilities. To accommodate faculty, staff and students who smoke, Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts and Deans may designate certain areas of existing courtyards and patios as smoking areas, and must provide ashtrays. The specific academic or administrative unit(s) will be responsible for absorbing all costs associated with providing designated smoking areas and ashtrays.</p>

                   <p>Stanford University values diversity and is committed to provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified employees, including those with disabilities. The University follows all state and federal laws and regulations, including the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (CFEHA), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). Disability is defined as any physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of an individual's major life activities (e.g., caring for oneself, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, sitting, standing). To ensure equality of access for employees with disabilities, the University will provide reasonable accommodations and auxiliary aids to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job and participate in University programs and activities.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Employees:</strong> are responsible for initiating requests for any desired disability related workplace accommodations. Requests by non-faculty employees should go to the supervisor or human resources manager; faculty employees should contact their Chair, departmental or school faculty affairs officer, or the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Supervisors:</strong> are responsible for receiving requests for workplace accommodations, informing employees of the process and referring requests to the appropriate human resources manager. Supervisors are responsible for initiating a discussion concerning accommodations when they have reason to believe an employee's disability precludes the employee from initiating a request. Supervisors should inform the local human resources manager of all requests and accommodations.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Human Resources Managers:</strong> are responsible for evaluating the request, determining what type of documentation is necessary, and determining if the requested accommodation is appropriate and effective. To identify your human resources manager, call the appropriate number: Campus (650) 721-4272; School of Medicine (650) 497-2750; SLAC (650) 926-2358.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Compliance Officer: </strong>The ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer provides information on the employment provisions of the ADA and employer obligations. You can also contact the Compliance Officer for information on campus accessibility, how to get technical and assistive equipment, and funding sources. You can reach the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity &amp; Access Office located in Kingscote Gardens, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, (650) 725-0326, FAX (650) 723-1791, TTY (650) 723-1216.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Chairs and Faculty Affairs Officers: </strong>are responsible for receiving requests for workplace accommodations and referring requests to the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer for handling under procedures similar to Section 3.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Step One - Request: </strong>The employee is responsible for requesting a workplace accommodation for his/her disability. The request shall be made to either the employee's supervisor or the local human resources manager. Requests should be in writing and include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Employee's name, telephone number and address</li> 
                    <li>Department</li> 
                    <li>Supervisor</li> 
                    <li>Physical or mental condition and its duration</li> 
                    <li>Nature of request</li> 
                    <li>Brief explanation of how the requested accommodation will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Step Two - Discussion: </strong>When received, the supervisor or human resources manager will meet with the employee to acknowledge the request and explain the process. The supervisor or human resources manager will also meet with the employee as necessary to discuss the request and accommodation alternatives.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Step Three - Documenting the Disability: </strong>The supervisor or human resources manager evaluating the requested accommodation will determine what type of documentation is necessary to verify the disability. This may vary depending on the nature and extent of the disability and the accommodation requested. It is the employee's responsibility to provide the requested documentation on his/her disability. If the University determines it is appropriate to get a second professional opinion concerning the nature or impact of a physical or mental disability, the Department will bear the cost of the second opinion.&nbsp;The request for an accommodation will be evaluated once the employee submits all documentation to the human resources manager and/or the supervisor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Step Four - Evaluation: </strong>Appropriate accommodations are determined following an individualized assessment of each request. The supervisor or human resources manager will consider the needs and requests for reasonable accommodation to determine whether the necessary equipment or services exist already in a different department or unit before investing in new equipment or additional services. Among the factors considered in determining reasonable accommodations for employees are:</p> 
                   <p><span style="line-height: 20px;">(1) What is the nature of the employee's physical or mental condition and how does it affect his/her needs in the workplace setting?</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(2) Does the employee's physical or mental condition limit one or more major life activities?</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(3)&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Will the requested accommodation allow the employee to perform the essential job&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">functions effectively?</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(4) Will the requested accommodation alter or remove an essential function of the job?</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(5) What impact will the requested accommodation or modification have on the department&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">or unit?</span></p> 
                   <p>The University is not required to provide an accommodation that will eliminate an essential function of the job in question or to provide an accommodation or service that is personal in nature, such as a hearing aid or wheelchair. Furthermore, the University is not required to lower performance, production or conduct standards, or alter attendance requirements expected of all employees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Step Five - Notification: </strong>The supervisor or human resources manager evaluating the request for an accommodation shall provide the employee with written notification of the determination within 15 calendar days of receiving the completed request (including the requested documentation). If the determination includes an accommodation, the notice will also include the expected implementation date. If the supervisor or the human resources manager needs additional time to assess a request or to provide an accommodation, he/she shall provide the employee with written notification of the status of the request and the proposed date of determination.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Health Risks</strong><br> It is widely recognized that the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, illegal drugs (collectively called <i>controlled substances</i><sup>1 </sup>and alcohol are major contributors to serious health problems and social and civic concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of controlled substances and alcohol include various physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe disability and death. Information concerning the known effects of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the&nbsp;<a href="http://super.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Substance Use Programs, Education &amp; Resources</a>&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">at (650) 723-3429.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Federal Legislation</strong><br> In response to these concerns, the U.S. Congress passed the <em>Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988</em>, the <em>Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989</em> and the <em>Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.</em>In accordance with these Acts, Stanford University has enacted the following policy applicable to all employees and students.</p> 
                   <p><sup>1</sup>Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C.812 and include, but are not limited to, such substances as marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace or as part of any of the University's activities. (For clarification of what activities related to controlled substances and alcohol are unlawful, see the Appendix at the end of this Guide Memo.) The workplace and campus include all Stanford premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Moreover, employees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol while at work. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and including termination of employment or expulsion. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.</p> 
                   <p><br> <strong>a. Employees</strong><br> As a condition of employment, all Stanford employees are expected to report to work in a condition that enables them to perform their job duties, with or without reasonable accommodation, in a safe manner that does not jeopardize their own safety or the safety of others.</p> 
                   <p>Employees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol while at work. "Under the influence" is a condition where an employee's sensory, cognitive, motor functions or job related capabilities are affected, impaired or diminished and may be exhibited through various behaviors including slurred speech, difficulty walking, red eyes, erratic or threatening behavior, the odor of alcohol, etc. (<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Lawfully prescribed prescription drugs used in accordance with their instructions are not subject to this policy.)</p> 
                   <p>Employees who unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess or use controlled substances or unlawfully use, possess, or distribute alcohol in the workplace, on the campus, or as part of any University activity will be subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. Employees required to obtain Commercial Drivers Licenses to drive vehicles heavier than 26,000 pounds, vehicles placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials, and/or vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons are subject to a protocol of testing for the use of drugs and alcohol in accordance with DOT guidelines. Employees at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory must comply with SLAC's Fitness for Duty policy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Students</strong><br> Students are bound by this policy and the&nbsp;<a href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/student-alcohol-and-other-drugs-policy" target="_blank">Stanford Student Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Others on Campus</strong><br> Individuals who are not Stanford employees, but who perform work at Stanford for its benefit (e.g., independent contractors, temporary employees provided by agencies, visitors engaged in joint projects at Stanford or volunteers) are required to comply with this policy. Such individuals who violate this policy may be barred from further work for and at Stanford.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Rehabilitation</strong><br> Successful completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program (including participation in aftercare) may be considered evidence of eligibility for continued or future employment or for reinstatement of student status.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Reporting of Convictions</strong><br> An employee who is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a criminal drug statute violation occurring in the workplace or on Stanford property must, notify Stanford University of the conviction within five days after the conviction. Notification must be in writing to the local human resources office, the Associate Vice President of Employee &amp; Labor Relations (for staff) or the Dean (for faculty).</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Responsibility for effective implementation and enforcement of the&nbsp;Stanford Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy&nbsp;begins with supervisors. Supervisors must be alert to indications or evidence of the use or presence of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Communication</strong><br> Supervisors must make sure that employees are aware of Stanford's Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">and understand that violation of this policy is a serious matter and cause for disciplinary action including possible termination.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Consultation with Human Resources</strong><br> If and when an employee is suspected of violating this policy, the supervisor should consult with the local human resources office to plan and carry out an appropriate investigation and resolution of the situation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Impaired Performance on the Job: Under the Influence of Controlled Substances or Alcohol in the Workplace</strong><br> Performance problems on the job can have many causes. In discussions with an employee concerning any performance problem, the supervisor should offer to help the employee determine the source of the problems and offer guidance on appropriate assistance, counseling or other resources.</p> 
                   <p>When job performance has become impaired, the supervisor should take normal corrective action, beginning with discussion with the employee. When the behavior of an employee on the job raises safety concerns for the employee and/or others in the workplace, the supervisor must take immediate action and prohibit the employee from continuing on the job until it is determined that he/she is fit to return to work and perform safely. Specific actions to be taken depend on the facts of the particular situation. Supervisors should consult with their local human resources office and document any cases of suspected employee impairment while at work.</p> 
                   <p>In a situation when the employee acknowledges to the supervisor that poor performance or unacceptable conduct results from a substance or alcohol abuse problem, the supervisor should urge the employee to seek help from a qualified substance abuse treatment resource. If the employee requests a leave of absence for a rehabilitation program, the supervisor should take normal steps to review the leave request. After a review of the situation, any misconduct, performance issues or policy violations which occur before, or coincident with, a voluntary admission of impairment may form the basis of disciplinary consequences up to and including termination.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Testing for Drugs and Alcohol</strong><br> Supervisors of employees who are required to obtain a Commercial Drivers License to drive vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds, vehicles placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials, and/or vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons are responsible for making sure the appropriate tests for the use of drugs and/or alcohol are administered through a suitable drug testing service provider. The department/ school is responsible for managing the testing process and determining if the use of an outside vendor is needed for this purpose.</p>

                   <p>The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, and/or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is regulated by a number of federal, state and local laws. These laws impose legal sanctions for both misdemeanor and felony convictions. Criminal penalties for convictions can range from fines and probation to denial or revocation of federal benefits (such as student loans) to imprisonment and forfeiture of personal and real property.<br> <br> This Appendix contains a list of some of the laws pertaining to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance or alcohol. Because the laws change from time to time, the information provided in the Appendix is illustrative, not exhaustive.

                   <p>At the discretion of each department or school, gifts or awards may be made to University employees for non-performance related recognition, such as to acknowledge years of service or celebrate retirement. The expense of such gifts or awards must come from appropriate University funds. In addition, the succeeding award guidelines must be followed or all or part of the value of gifts or awards will be reportable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as taxable income to the employee.</p> 
                   <p>This policy does not cover ordinary business expenses in the promotion of employee morale. Examples of such business expenses are: <em>occasional </em>business lunches; office gatherings; or flowers for bereavement, hospitalization, or family crises. Nor does this policy cover performance-based awards or bonuses, which are generally taxable to the recipient and are processed through Payroll. Furthermore, this policy does not preclude individual faculty or staff members from giving personal gifts to their colleagues provided University funds are not used for this purpose.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>A regular staff employee and an academic staff employee must be in active service on his/her anniversary date to receive the length-of-service award. Length of service is determined by computing the period of service as defined in <a href="/2-1-6">Guide Memo 2.1.6</a>:&nbsp;Vacations, Section 1.a. The following length-of-service/retirement award guidelines have been developed according to IRS regulations. Awards which adhere to the following parameters and are given to eligible employees are not subject to taxes:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Timing</strong><br> The length-of-service or retirement award may not be made within the employee's first five years of service or more frequently than every five years.&nbsp;Length-of-service or retirement awards given within the first five years of service or more frequently than every five years will be taxable in full and must be reported as such to the Controller's Office.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Dollar Limit</strong><br> The value or cost of the length-of-service or retirement award should not exceed $400 during the taxable year. Also, it is recommended that the value or cost of the award be commensurate with the number of years of service being recognized (e.g., the 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). Length-of-service or retirement awards with a value or cost over $400 will be taxable to the extent the value or cost exceeds the dollar limit (e.g., if a $450 award is given, then $50 will be taxable).</p> 
                   <p>If the staff employee elects to retire the same year he/she becomes eligible for a length-of-service award, then the maximum total value or cost of the award(s) should not exceed $400 for the award(s) to be nontaxable. In rare circumstances the nontaxable amount of the award may be higher than $400. Any exceptions must be approved in advance by the Controller's Office Business Expense Manager.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Form of Awards</strong><br> In order to avoid tax reporting as income, the award must be in the form of tangible personal property. The IRS does not consider gift cards, gift coupons, gift certificates, vacations, meals, lodging or tickets to theater or sporting events for service or retirement awards to be tangible personal property, and accordingly, they are subject to tax. If the award is in the form of cash, check, or gift certificate, the value of such items is treated as additional wages regardless of cost or value (see Section 5.a. below for an exception for nominal gifts).</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Meaningful Presentation</strong><br> The award must be presented in a <span class="suggestion">meaningful</span> presentation or ceremony. Every attempt should be made to give a length-of-service/retirement award during the year the anniversary occurs. To avoid tax liabilities to the attendees, departments or schools should ensure that special presentation events are conducted only on an occasional basis and that the costs of the events are reasonable.</p> 
                   <p>Deans/Vice Provosts/Vice Presidents are responsible for ensuring that award programs at different levels within their organization comply with all the above IRS requirements for nontaxable gifts.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Faculty members with more than 5 years of service are eligible to receive an award from the University upon retirement or departure from the University to recognize their service and contribution. (Faculty members do not participate in the staff 5-year incremental length-of-service award.) For retirement awards to be nontaxable to the recipient, they must meet the 5-year service requirement noted in this section as well as the requirements listed under Sections 3.b. to 3.d. of this policy. Any award that does not meet the IRS requirements will be taxable income and must be reported as such to the Controller's Office. For example, if an award is granted prior to 5 years of service or is a gift certificate, the entire award amount is taxable income. Also, if the award value/cost exceeds $400, then any amount over $400 will be taxable (e.g., if a $600 retirement award is given, then the $200 over the dollar limit will be taxable income).</p> 
                   <p>It is the Department Chair's responsibility to ensure that awards comply with the IRS requirements. In rare circumstances the non-taxable amount of the award may be higher than $400.

                   <p>Each department or school determines who is eligible and what occasions warrant the gift. To ensure these gifts are nontaxable to the recipient(s), departments need to follow the IRS regulations outlined below:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Dollar Limit</strong><br> The aggregate gift value should not exceed $50 per individual. If the value of the gift(s) exceeds $50, then the entire gift will be taxable. Qualifying gift certificates in amounts not exceeding $50 will be considered nominal and not taxable. To qualify, a gift certificate must be one that requires the recipient to exchange the certificate for tangible personal property from the issuing vendor, and cannot be convertible to cash or used to reduce the balance of the recipient's account with the company issuing the gift certificate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Frequency</strong><br> The gift should be given only on an occasional basis. Gifts given to an employee(s) on a regular or routine basis do not qualify for nontaxable treatment and must be reported as taxable income.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Noncash Gift</strong><br> The gift must be tangible personal property. That is, it may not be a check, or a gift certificate over $50. (see qualifying gift certificate description in 5.a. above).</p>

The name of the employee and the occasion for the gift (e.g., 10-year service) must be included on the request or included in the PCard verification information to ensure timely processing. For more information see <a href="/chapter-5/subchapter-4/policy-5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Taxable Gifts/Awards</strong><br> The cost of gifts or awards that fail to meet one or more of the IRS requirements outlined in this policy may be paid personally and reimbursed by the University using the Oracle Financials reimbursement application or purchased using a University PCard. The name of the employee, his/her employee ID number and occasion for the gift must be included on the request, or included in the PCard verification information, to ensure timely processing of the request. All reimbursements processed for these types of gifts will be sent to the Payroll Department and the amounts will be included in the employee's W2 or 1099 forms. For more information, see <a href="/5-4-3">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses. Any gift purchased using the PCard must be clearly identified in the business purpose as being a gift. The PCard verifier must be able to provide tax information to Disbursements upon request in order to properly complete any required tax reporting to the recipient.

                   <p><strong>a. Courses Available</strong><br> It is necessary to limit the audit privilege to lecture courses. Auditing is not feasible and will not be authorized for courses which involve individual instruction such as creative writing, acting, studio art, music practice, language practice (grammar or conversation), seminars, and courses with laboratories.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility to Audit With Waiver of Fees</strong><br> The usual fee for auditing will be waived for faculty members and for regular employees, and also for regular employees when the course will improve the employee's efficiency on the job.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Procedures</strong><br> Registration forms for auditing are available at the Student Services Center in Tresidder Memorial Union or on the <a href="https://registrar.stanford.edu/resources-and-help/student-forms/other-forms" target="_blank">Registrar's website</a>. All auditors must obtain the course instructor's permission to audit. Staff employees must also obtain written permission from the department head stating that the course will improve the employee's effectiveness and that time off is approved if needed. All persons requesting to audit will be required to present their Stanford I.D. card at the time they register.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Eligible University employees can participate in a variety of family and medical leaves and disability benefit plans. Policies are described in this document. Before you go out on leave, consult with your local Human Resources office.&nbsp;Important information regarding the scope and use of the disability benefit plans is included in the relevant plan brochures available on the Cardinal at Work website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Specific Process for filing a disability claim: </strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> The employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to their immediate supervisor.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> The employee calls Stanford's disability administrator&nbsp;to initiate a claim. The disability administrator will inform the employee if there are any forms or certification documents to submit.<br> <strong>(3)</strong> If the employee does not call the disability administrator, it is the department's responsibility to notify the disability administrator.<br> <strong>(4) </strong>Continue steps per general process for all disabilities in section 1.b.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. General Process:</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Timeliness</strong><br> Employees must give notice of anticipated family or medical leaves and file claims for disability plan benefits as soon as feasible. Notice should be given to the immediate supervisor, the local Human Resources office and the disability administrator. For work-related leaves, refer to section 4, Workers' Compensation. For example, an employee who will be hospitalized on a pre-determined date should contact the disability administrator before entering the hospital. In addition, the employee must submit the signed Authorization to Release Information form to their physician's office as soon as possible. No disability benefits can be paid until&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">has received the completed physician's form with appropriate verification of the disability. If not hospitalized, the employee still needs to report the absence to the disability administrator and their supervisor.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Workers' Compensation</strong><br> When the employee's disability is, or may be, work-related, the department should report the circumstances to the Risk Management Office within 24 hours of the employee's injury. See section 4, Workers' Compensation. SLAC employees should refer to <a href="http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/hr/wc/">SLAC Human Resources </a>for the relevant reporting requirements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) The local Human Resources office</strong><br> The local Human Resources office notifies and coordinates with the disability administrator. The local Human Resources office works with the employee, their supervisor and the disability administrator to ensure that information is communicated in a timely manner.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) DLS</strong><br> Disability and Leave Services (DLS) in University Human Resources updates employee's record in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS) and works with the disability administrator to ensure accurate time card reporting and pay.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(5) Supervisor's Ongoing Communication</strong><br> The supervisor (or local Human Resources office on the supervisor's behalf) should routinely check the determination made on the employee's claim for short-term (VDI/SDI) disability benefit or Workers' Compensation benefit payments. The supervisor should arrange with the employee to be kept informed about the estimated return to work date for an employee who is absent for an extended period. If the employee is unable to advise the supervisor personally about their inability to return to work, the supervisor should make other arrangements to be kept advised of the status of the employee's return to work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(6)</strong> <strong>Medical Certification</strong><br> The employee must contact&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;to initiate a leave request and open a disability or Paid Family Leave (PFL) claim, who</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;will then work with the employee to obtain the necessary certification from a health care provider. The employee must provide certification within 15 days to&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. Certification is also required to request a leave extension.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(7)</strong> <strong>Length of Leave</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Maximum Duration<br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em; font-weight: 400;">Except as otherwise required by law, the maximum duration that a regular employee is eligible to be on an approved medical leave of absence due to a non-work-related injury or illness is no more than 12 consecutive months, inclusive of any periods of full- or part-time leave, Family Medical leave, pregnancy disability leave, or leave for personal reasons. If, through the interactive process, it is determined that an employee is unable to return to work at the end of an approved medical leave with or without reasonable accommodations, the employee will be terminated. Twelve months of leave is not guaranteed. The maximum duration of leave will be determined based on the particular circumstances of the situation, including the operational needs of the department, the number of times extensions of leave have been previously granted, and any disability accommodation leave that may have been granted.</span></strong></li> 
                    <li><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Exceptions<br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em; font-weight: 400;">If a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from the local Human Resources office and in concurrence with the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee). Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the local Human Resources office. Such exceptions are likely to be approved only in limited circumstances.</span></strong></li>

                   <p><strong>a. Introduction</strong><br> Family Medical Leave is leave authorized by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Certain leaves for members of the armed forces and their families are outlined in <a href="/2-1-18">Guide Memo 2.1.18</a>. In most cases, FMLA and CFRA run concurrently with each other and with Short-Term Disability Leave, including leave due to work-related illness or injury<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">, and with Paid Family Leave (PFL).</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">&nbsp;Eligible employees are assured up to 12 weeks unpaid leave during a rolling 12-month period&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">that begins on the verified FMLA/CFRA start date</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">. "Assured" means the department cannot refuse the leave when any one of the following situations is appropriately verified:</span></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The birth of a child or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. Under CFRA, if both parents are employed by Stanford, each parent is eligible for up to 12 weeks of baby bonding leave.<br> Limitations: Leave for birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care should generally be taken in blocks of time (two weeks minimum) and must be concluded within the first 12 months after the birth or placement. A request for baby bonding leave in less than two weeks' duration may be granted on any two occasions.</li> 
                    <li>A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform his or her job.</li>

                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility</strong><br> Employees working in the U.S. are eligible if employed by Stanford at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not included) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Notification</strong><br> Employees are expected to provide 30 days advance notice to their manager when the need for leave is foreseeable (i.e., anticipated date of birth, adoption or planned medical treatment). When advance notice is not possible, employees should give as much advance notice as feasible. If advance notice is not provided when the employee had sufficient prior knowledge of the need for leave, the department may deny leave until 30 days have elapsed. Such denial should be made only when operationally necessary, and always in consultation with the local Human Resources office. Employees are required to give a minimum of two days' notice if the return to work will be later or earlier than the expected return date.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Medical Certification</strong><br> The employee must call&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span>&nbsp;to request FMLA/CFRA leave. T<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">he disability administrator&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">will work with the employee to obtain certification from a health care provider that the employee, their child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner has a serious health condition, the condition's expected duration, and the need for the employee to attend to the family member. The employee must provide certification within 15 days to&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">. Certification is also required to request a leave extension.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Intermittent Leave</strong><br> Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA/CFRA leave intermittently (taking leave in separate blocks of time for a single qualifying reason) or on a reduced schedule (reducing the employee's usual weekly or daily work schedule). When leave is needed for planned medical treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment to avoid unduly disrupting department operations.</p> 
                   <p>For birth and care of a child or "baby bonding" under California (CFRA) law, an employee may use intermittent leave in segments of two weeks. A request for baby bonding leave of less than two weeks duration may be granted on any two occasions.</p>

Introduction</strong><br> Under California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence up to 30 days for the purpose of organ donation and up to five days for bone marrow donation. The leave may be taken in increments during any one-year period. The one-year period starts on the first day of leave. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required (see section 4.d). Periods of authorized Paid Organ Donor leave do not run concurrently with either FMLA or CFRA leave and are not counted against an employee's annual FMLA/CFRA entitlement.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility</strong><br> The employee must complete at least 90 days of service with the University before requesting Paid Organ Donor leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Medical Certification</strong><br> The employee must call&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span>&nbsp;to request a Paid Organ Donor leave and provide written medical verification that the employee is an organ or bone marrow donor and the medical necessity for the donation.

                   <p><strong>d. Pay During Leave</strong><br> During the period of Paid Organ Donor leave, employees will be required to use five days of accrued time for bone marrow donation and 10 days for organ donation. Once the amount of required accrued time is used, the employee will be on a paid leave of absence for the remainder of the Paid Organ Donor leave.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="workers'-compensation"><span class="prefix-container">5. </span>Workers' Compensation</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Introduction</strong><br> The purpose of this coverage is to provide partial income continuation during absences resulting from work-related injuries or illnesses, and payment of necessary medical, surgical, and hospital services for such injuries and illnesses. The university pays the full cost of Workers' Compensation coverage. Workers' Compensation payments are a non-taxable benefit paid directly to the employee by a third party administrator.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility</strong><br> All employees of the university, including student employees, staff, and faculty, are covered by Workers' Compensation. Work-related disability provisions are applicable to temporary, student and casual employees; however, the charging (or not charging) of vacation and/or sick time is not applicable.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Reporting and Recording Work Injuries and Related Absences From Work</strong><br> Departments have additional requirements for reporting all work-related injuries and illnesses. See <a href="/7-6-1">Guide Memo 7.6.1</a>:&nbsp;Accident and Incident Reporting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Payments</strong><br> The Workers' Compensation administrator normally pays benefits from the fourth day of the disability period or the first day of hospitalization, whichever occurs first. If the employee is out of work more than 14 days (need not be consecutive) with a doctor's authorization, the three-day waiting period is waived and retroactive payments will be made so that payments start with the first day of disability. For Workers' Compensation, Stanford charges up to the initial five full work days of absence (days need not be consecutive) of an accepted claim to work-related disability paid leave. The university will augment the Workers' Compensation benefit with salary during this period. An employee's sick time or vacation is not charged for these days of absence. By state law, an employee may not receive both Workers' Compensation benefits and full pay. Therefore, employees are required to reimburse the university for any Workers' Compensation benefits paid for the first five days including any associated holidays, because the university has already paid the employee for the time. For part-time employees, the full day is prorated based on the employee's normal work schedule.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Delayed Claims</strong><br> If acceptance of a claim is delayed, the initial five full days of absence (need not be consecutive) are charged to accumulated sick time and the claim is handled as a short-term non-work-related disability. If accumulated sick time is exhausted, the time is charged to accrued PTO, floating holiday and vacation, in that order. If the employee does not have enough accrued time, the remaining hours are unpaid. If the claim is then accepted under Workers' Compensation, any sick, PTO, floating holiday, and /or vacation time taken during the first five days will be restored.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Supplementing Workers' Compensation Payments</strong><br> Employees may receive both paid leave and disability plan benefits concurrently, not to exceed the employee's base pay. After the initial five work days of disability, accumulated sick, PTO, floating holiday and vacation time will be used, in that order, to supplement Workers' Compensation benefits. Thus, the employee continues to receive income equivalent to full pay.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Role of Disability and Leave Services</strong><br> Disability and Leave Services (DLS) within University Human Resources updates the Human Resources Management System (HRMS) records each pay period for all employees on absences due to work-related disability. DLS makes certain that combined income from disability payments and Stanford does not exceed pre-disability pay and keeps accurate records of leave time used.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. More Information</strong><br> Details regarding claims procedures, accident reports, and related matters may be obtained from the Risk Management Office, (650) 723-7400, <a href="https://orm.stanford.edu/insurance/workers-compensation">Workers' Compensation Benefits</a>. Also, <a href="/7-6-1">Guide Memo 7.6.1</a>: Accident and Incident Reporting, has additional information about Workers' Compensation.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Use of Accrued Time</strong><br> Accrued time consists of sick time, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday for the calendar year and vacation, to be used in that order. During medical leaves (including Workers' Compensation, FMLA, CFRA and PDL), the university will use an employee's accrued time to maintain the employee's base pay. For Paid Family Leaves (PFL), please see section 6.d. When the employee is also receiving disability benefits, DLS ensures that combined income from both the disability vendor and the University does not exceed pre-disability pay. Accrued time is used until the employee goes off disability, including Worker's Compensation, or until all balances are exhausted. The use of some forms of accrued time is at the employee's option during certain FMLA/CFRA leaves. If an employee chooses not to use accrued time during a medical leave, the employee must&nbsp;notify DLS by email within 24-48 hours of their claim being approved. An employee's request to opt out of the payment practice can only be for future pay cycles and not retroactively. Disability and Leave Services (DLS) administers the employee's records in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS). Procedures at SLAC will differ.</p> 
                   <p>Thus, if the employee has accrued time and is also receiving disability benefits, the employee will receive disability checks from&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span>&nbsp;and/or the Worker's Compensation administrator and reduced paychecks from the university until their accrued time has been exhausted. Once the accrued time is exhausted, the employee will only receive disability checks from the disability vendor for the duration of the approved leave.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Overpayment</strong><br> If an employee has been overpaid, the employee must reimburse the university for the overpayment either by direct payment or through payroll deduction.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Voluntary Disability Insurance / Short-Term Disability </strong><br> <strong>(1) Introduction</strong><br> The university's VDI plan is state-approved to take the place of SDI by providing benefits that are better than those of the state's plan. The VDI plan provides partial income continuation for periods of disability of up to 52 weeks or a maximum dollar amount. This plan is described in the Statement of Coverage available on the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-away/leaves-of-absence/disability-benefits" target="_blank">Cardinal at Work website</a>.&nbsp;For information on SDI, go to the Employment Development Department's website at <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov">www.edd.ca.gov</a>.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Eligibility</strong><br> Faculty and staff based in California are covered for short-term disabilities by either the university's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan (VDI) or State Disability Insurance (SDI) if the employee opted out of VDI. Non-California employees are covered under a separate 13-week short-term disability plan (STD).<br> <strong>(3) Benefit Waiting Period</strong><br> Refer to the Voluntary Disability Insurance Statement of Coverage on the <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/my-offerings" target="_blank">Cardinal at Work website</a>.<br> <strong>(4) Taxability</strong><br> Short-term disability (VDI/SDI) payments are non-taxable benefits. These non-taxable benefits are paid directly to the employee by&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">the disability administrator</span>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Paid Family Leave (PFL) </strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Introduction</strong><br> This California state program provides partial income replacement during absences from work to care for seriously ill family members (parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or parent-in-law) or to bond with a new child. It is not a separate type of leave.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Eligibility</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Faculty and staff based in California </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">contribute to a Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance benefit according to state law as part of the VDI deduction.</span><br> <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(3)</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> </span><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Supplementing PFL Payments</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">During PFL, eligible employees will receive a portion of their base pay, up to a weekly maximum, from the disability administrator or state disability program, for up to eight weeks in a rolling 12-month period. The university will supplement the approved state paid family leave benefit&nbsp;to maintain the eligible employee’s base pay for the first six weeks that the employee is receiving PFL benefits.&nbsp;For the additional two weeks that the employee is eligible for PFL benefits, they may elect to use sick, vacation, floating holiday or PTO time, combined with the approved state leave, to maintain their base pay</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.01em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Together, the state PFL and the university’s supplement will not exceed 100% of an employee’s base pay as of their last day worked before starting their leave.&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p>Disability and Leave Services (DLS) within University Human Resources administers the employee's records in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS). DLS ensures that combined income from both the disability vendor and the university does not exceed pre-disability pay.

                   <p><strong>e. Long-Term Disability (LTD) </strong><br> <strong>(1) Introduction</strong><br> This plan provides partial income continuation during longer periods of disability. LTD benefits could start after a disability period of 90 consecutive days. After a disability period of 15 months, the plan's benefits are more restricted because a more stringent definition of "disability" is used.<br> <strong>(2) Eligibility</strong><br> Employees whose approved disability continues past 90 consecutive days may be eligible for Long-Term Disability. The disability vendor provides the employee with the appropriate information when the employee's disability period approaches 90 days.</p> 
                   <p>Eligible employees based outside of California in a state that offers paid family leave must apply for paid family benefits through their state.</p> 
                   <p>Eligible employees based outside of California in a state that does not offer paid family leave benefits can file a paid family claim through Stanford's disability vendor.<br> <strong>(3) Taxability</strong><br> Long-term disability benefits are taxable for federal and state, non-taxable for FICA.<br> <strong>(4) More Information</strong><br> The Summary Plan Description for the Long-Term Disability Plan provides information about coverage, definition of disability, and benefits.

                   <p><strong>c. Foreign Student Advisor</strong><br> Assists students with immigration, social, cultural and adjustment issues. The office is located at Bechtel International Center (<a href="mailto:internationalstudents@stanford.edu">internationalstudents@stanford.edu</a>)</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Local Human Resources Office</strong><br> Responsible for providing guidance, reviewing and verifying materials prepared by departments for non-academic staff for H-1B visas and submitting completed petitions to Foreign Scholar Services at Bechtel Center. Guidance will also be provided on the processing of a visa petition for academic staff, post docs or faculty.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Legal Representation</strong><br> In the event that, in the opinion of the Foreign Scholar Services Office, an issue requires legal interpretation or advice, the Office of the General Counsel will review the matter and determine whether or how it should be pursued. Departments or individuals may not engage private attorneys to represent the University to government agencies. This policy, however, does not prevent an individual foreign national from retaining legal counsel (and paying for any legal fees incurred as a result) for the purpose of obtaining his or her own legal advice or pursuing a self-sponsored immigrant petition, provided the University is not named as a petitioning employer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f.

                   <p><strong>a. Contents</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) PostGrads</strong><br> The PostGrads alumni information database includes basic demographic data for Stanford alumni, parents of students, and University friends, including corporations and foundations. This file is used to create mailing lists for the Stanford Magazine and various mailings and solicitations sent by the Office of Development, the Stanford Alumni Association, and the University. The data in this file may be selected according to particular purposes, such as those alumni who received law degrees in 1980. The Office of Development maintains and controls PostGrads.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Department and School Databases</strong><br> Some departments and schools keep records of their own alumni and friends. The following restrictions apply to such databases:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Schools and departments may receive data changes as a result of their mailings. The data changes should be sent to </span><a href="mailto:alumni.information@stanford.edu" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">alumni.information@stanford.edu</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"> for updating in PostGrads.</span></li> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Any use of PostGrads information for gift solicitations outside of the Office of Development must be approved in advance by the Office of the Vice President for Development.</span></li> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Any use of records must be consistent with the purpose communicated to the persons providing such information.</span></li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>b. Sources of Information</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Alumni</strong><br> Data on current and graduated students is downloaded to PostGrads from PeopleSoft Student Administration. Although recent graduates can update information in Axess, information is not currently shared between Axess and PostGrads.<br> <strong>(2) Parents</strong><br> Data on parents of Stanford students is forwarded to Development Services and PostGrads by the Stanford Parents Program in the Office of Development, which receives the information from the New Undergraduate Student Information Project, administered by the Housing Center.</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>Stanford Friends</strong></span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Data on Stanford friends is forwarded to Development Services by various other sections of the Development Office.</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>c. How Data Changes are Made</strong><br> Development Services enters changes into PostGrads. Sources of information for changes are returned mail, postal change of address cards, correspondence with individuals on the list, changes made by the individual via their online profile, and notification from a University department with which the individual is associated. Information needed includes:</span></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The individual's University ID number</span></li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>d. Outputs from File</strong><br> <strong>(1) Lists for Directories</strong><br> Directories of specific populations published by schools use PostGrads as source data.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Labels and Address Lists</strong></span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Departments and schools needing output from PostGrads should contact their School's Development Office for assistance, after obtaining approval from the Office of the Vice President for Development. Mailing information will be prepared only for University departments. If an outside vendor provides mailing services, the department is responsible for assuring that the vendor will protect the confidentiality of the data and will gain no rights over the data.</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>e. Control of File</strong><br> Only Development Services may make changes to PostGrads biographic and gift information. The Director of Development Services acts as coordinator in resolving questions that may arise in application of University policies on use of PostGrads.</span></p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The privileges enabled through use of each type of ID Card vary widely. In this section, certain privileges are detailed for reference purposes only, and no reliance should be placed on these descriptions to detail all University facilities and services for which ID Cards grant access, or the eligibility criteria established for their use. Established eligibility criteria are subject to change without notice, and access to facilities and services may be denied at any time. In addition, management of each facility may limit or prohibit use of a facility by an individual card holder who, in the facility management's sole discretion, violates the rules governing use of the facility or other policies established by the University or facility management.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation (DAPER):</strong> Holders of Student, Postdoctoral, Faculty/Staff, SLAC Faculty/Staff, Temp/Casual, SLAC Temp/Casual, Fellow, Visitor and Courtesy Cards have access to certain facilities and events specified by DAPER, subject to payment of established amounts, if any, for tickets or use fees.

                   <p><strong>b. Libraries:</strong> While a Stanford Identification Card may be necessary to gain access to campus library resources, the possession of an ID Card does not assure access to any library. Stanford Libraries has written regulations governing the use of its libraries.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Administration of Insurance</strong><br> The Risk Management Office is responsible for obtaining insurance and self-insurance coverage and processing all claims.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Who Pays for Insurance</strong><br> Risk Management charges income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries and general funds for their Aggregate Annual Insurance Premiums.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Special Insurance Coverage</strong><br> Any department having special risks that it feels should be insured should discuss the issue with Risk Management. If insurance does appear to be the best way of managing a risk, Risk Management will negotiate a policy with the insurance carrier and rebill the cost to the requesting department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. What to do in the Event of an Accident</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Emergency Action</strong><br> Take whatever steps are immediately necessary to render emergency medical care, salvage property, or reduce the further extent of the loss. If anyone is injured, see <a href="/7-2-1">Guide Memo 7.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Emergency/Accident Procedures, for emergency procedures, and <a href="/7-6-1">Guide Memo 7.6.1</a>:&nbsp;Accident and Incident Reporting, for reporting requirements. Report injuries promptly to comply with state law.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Evidence for Insurance Claim</strong><br> If possible, do not disturb the evidence or hazard which caused the claim until the area can be inspected, pictures taken, and conditions recorded. Obtain the names and addresses of parties involved, witnesses, etc. Under no circumstances should one admit liability; to do so could jeopardize the insurance coverage. As soon as possible record the details of the accident. The report should include: date, time, place, who or what was involved, how it happened, names, addresses, and estimated ages of persons involved; description of injury, loss or damage; and action that was or will be taken to prevent a recurrence. All claims must be reported immediately to Risk Management.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. General Property Insurance&nbsp;</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Situations Covered</strong><br> Stanford's insurance and self-insurance on buildings and their contents includes coverage for fire, smoke, windstorm, explosion, riot, civil commotion, vandalism, malicious mischief, falling aircraft, and theft.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Situations not Covered</strong><br> The University does not provide insurance coverage for the following situations:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Damage caused by rough wear and tear, rust, dust, mechanical failure, maintenance problems, breakage, scratching, marring and staining</li> 
                    <li>Items identified as lost as a result of inventory</li> 
                    <li>Failed experiments, or lost or damaged research efforts</li> 
                    <li>Management errors, financial decisions, or lost income or opportunities</li> 
                    <li>Government-owned property</li> 
                    <li>Personal property of faculty, staff, or students</li> 
                    <li>Damage caused by earthquake, or natural disaster flood</li> 
                    <li>Damage caused by terrorism or bioterrorism, except damage due to terrorism as defined by TRIA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) is covered.</li> 
                    <li>In any country where trade relations are unlawful, as determined by the Government of the United States of America or its agencies, are not covered. In addition other countries may be excluded from time to time. Please see the <a href="https://orm.stanford.edu/">Risk Management</a> website&nbsp;for a current list of excluded countries.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>Deductible</strong><br> The first $1,000,000 of each claim is self-insured by the University. The department that suffered the loss or damage of property pays for the first $1,000 of each claim. See <a href="/2-4-5">Guide Memo 2.4.5</a>:&nbsp;Protection of Property, for information on possible waivers of the $1,000 deductible through the Police Department's STOPP program.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Claim Processing</strong><br> Risk Management processes all claims for the replacement value or repair of University property that has been stolen, destroyed or damaged. Depending upon the type, size and location of the loss, Procurement or Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE) will be directly involved in the repairs or reconstruction. The preparation of specifications and a bidding process may be necessary. Risk Management must receive copies of all contracts, work orders, and purchase requisitions.</p> 
                   <p>In the event a claim exceeds $1000, insurance or self-insurance may pay for repair or replacement value (whichever is less). "Replacement value" means the cost to repair or replace (not book value). Loss settlements are based on the cost to repair or replace with like kind and quality. Any upgrading will be at the cost of the department that suffers the loss. If property is not to be replaced (due to obsolescence or no continuing need or use for the property) insurance proceeds will not be based on the actual cash or depreciated value.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Heavy Machinery </strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Situations Covered</strong><br> Insurance covers explosion, burning, bulging, and cracking of insured objects; machinery and equipment are covered for sudden and accidental breakdown.<br> <strong>(2) Deductible</strong><br> There is a $25,000 deductible per occurrence, except $50,000 for medical diagnostic equipment, the full amount of which is coordinated with LBRE/Buildings and Grounds Maintenance (or the department if it is a service center, an income-producing operation, or an auxiliary).</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Budgeting Total Property Insurance Expense</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> Total Property Insurance Expense includes General Property Insurance and Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Heavy Machinery Insurance. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Risk Management department will secure an actuarial study of claims under the Property Insurance Program. The actuarial study will provide two key figures that will be used to budget future property insurance expenses:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(a) </strong>Self-insurance reserve required to fund claims (and related expenses) that have occurred prior to the end of the recently completed fiscal year but have not yet been settled/completed. (This can be an accumulation of several years of claims estimates, net of settlements). This actuarial required reserve may be higher or lower than the actual reserve balance at Fiscal Year End.<br> <strong>(b) </strong>Actuarial projected self-insurance funding levels, or cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the next fiscal year. This will be the amount added to the reserve balance each year to cover claims incurred in that year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2)</strong> During the budget planning cycle (and no later than February 1), Risk Management will provide the Budget Office with the Aggregate Annual Premium to be charged internally for Property Insurance during the next fiscal year. At the same time, Risk Management will also provide the income-producing operations, formula schools, and auxiliaries with their respective property premium allocation to be charged during the next fiscal year. The Aggregate Premium will be composed of the following five elements:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(a) </strong>Actuarial Projection of self-insurance funding for the cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the budget year.<br> <strong>(b)</strong> A reserve for future catastrophic events.<br> <strong>(c) </strong>Risk Management's estimate of premiums to be paid to outside insurers for excess coverage insurance during the next fiscal year.<br> <strong>(d) </strong>Risk Management's estimate of other direct expenses (e.g., actuarial studies, legal expenses, brokerage fees, operating expenses) associated with the Property Insurance Program.<br> <strong>(e)</strong> 30% of the surplus or deficit in the self-insurance reserve to the actuarial required reserve balance at the prior year-end. The application of a portion of the surplus or deficit (vs. 100%) is intended to provide a smoothing effect to avoid large year-to-year changes in the Aggregate Premium.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) </strong>The Aggregate Annual Premium is allocated to income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries, and general funds based on property replacement values.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Situations Covered</strong><br> Stanford's insurance on transit covers all goods shipped inland to or by Stanford when the transit agreement assigns the risk to Stanford. For large (over 75 lbs.) or complicated shipments, including packing and crating, departments are encouraged to use American Overseas Air Freight.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Situations Not Covered</strong><br> <strong>(1) </strong>Situations described in section 2.a (c).<br> <strong>(2) </strong>Waterborne shipments, unless by inland water, by roll-on/roll-off ferries operating between European ports, or by coastal shipments<br> <strong>(3) </strong>Shipments to any country where trade relations are unlawful as determined by the Government of the United States of America or its agencies are not covered. In addition other countries may be excluded from time to time. Please see the <a href="https://orm.stanford.edu/">Risk Management</a> website for a current list of excluded countries.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Deductible</strong><br> The first $50,000 of each claim is self-insured by the University. The first $1,000 of each claim loss is the responsibility of the department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Claim Processing</strong><br> Immediate notification of loss to Risk Management is required for losses greater than $1,000. Risk Management must receive copies of contracts, purchase orders, bills of lading or any transit agreements, shipping documents and/or invoices.</p>

(For information on coverage for vehicles, including personal vehicles used on University business, see <a href="/8-4-2">Guide Memo 8.4.2</a>:&nbsp;Vehicle Use. Liability insurance also covers non-owned aircraft, watercraft, professional liability, employers' liability, products liability, etc. University trustees, officers, faculty, and staff are included as additional insureds for activities arising out of and in the scope of their employment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Situations Not Covered</strong><br> Stanford and insurers do not cover employees or others for their following personal acts:</p>

                    <li>Acts not connected with or arising out of or related to Stanford employment or Stanford activities (e.g., personal gain, etc.)</li> 
                    <li>Fines, penalties or punishment which government authorities or law places on an individual (includes traffic fines, jail sentences, etc.)</li>

                   <p><strong>c. Deductible</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Public Liability</strong><br> The first $1,000,000 of each claim for public liability is self-insured by the University.<br> <strong>(2) Employee and/or Student Relations</strong><br> The first $1,000,000 of each claim for liability claims involving student and/or employee relations is self-insured by the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Claim Processing</strong><br> Upon becoming aware of an incident, which could lead to a liability claim or when a claim for liability is received, the department should immediately notify Risk Management.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Budgeting Liability Insurance Expense</strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> Liability Insurance includes General Liability, Educators Legal Liability, Automotive, Non-owned Aviation, and Crime Insurance. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Risk Management department will secure an actuarial study of claims under the Liability Insurance Program. The actuarial study will provide two key figures that will be used to budget future liability insurance expenses:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(a) </strong>Self-insurance reserve required to fund claims (and related expenses) that have occurred prior to the end of the recently completed fiscal year but have not yet been settled/completed. (This can be an accumulation of many years of claims estimates, net of settlements) This actuarial required reserve may be higher or lower than the actual reserve balance at Fiscal Year End.<br> <strong>(b)</strong> Actuarial projected self-insurance funding levels, or cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the next fiscal year. (This will be the amount added to the reserve balance each year to cover claims incurred in that year.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2)</strong> During the budget planning cycle (and no later than February 1), Risk Management will provide the Budget Office with the Aggregate Annual Premium to be charged internally for Liability Insurance during the next fiscal year. At the same time, Risk Management will also provide the income-producing operations, formula schools, and auxiliaries with their respective liability premium allocation to be charged during the next fiscal year. The Aggregate Premium will be composed of the following four elements:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(a) </strong>Actuarial Projection of self-insurance funding for the cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the budget year<br> <strong>(b) </strong>Risk Management's estimate of premiums to be paid to outside insurers for excess coverage insurance during the next fiscal year<br> <strong>(c) </strong>Risk Management's estimate of other direct expenses (e.g., actuarial studies, legal expenses, brokerage fees, operating expenses) associated with the Liability Insurance Program<br> <strong>(d)</strong> 30% of the surplus or deficit in the self-insurance reserve to the actuarial required reserve balance at the prior year-end. The application of a portion of the surplus or deficit (vs. 100%) is intended to provide a smoothing effect to avoid large year-to-year changes in the Aggregate Premium.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Allocation of Liability Insurance Expense</strong><br> A portion of the Aggregate Annual Premium will be carved out and allocated to certain income-producing operations, formula schools and auxiliaries based on use, attendance, occupancy and square footage measures. The balance of the Aggregate Annual Premium after carve outs is then allocated to all income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries, and general funds based on the prior year's actual payroll and headcount data.</p> 
                   <p>Vehicle insurance premiums are allocated on a per vehicle basis and are not included in the Liability Aggregate Annual Premium calculations.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Allocation of Settlement Costs</strong><br> Following the end of each fiscal year, Risk Management will provide an analysis of the cost of settling all liability claims paid during the year (regardless of the year the claim was incurred). To the extent settlement costs for a particular income-producing operation, Formula School, or auxiliary exceeds the liability insurance premium paid by that unit over the same time period, the unit will be responsible for paying eighty percent (80%) of the excess cost back to the self-insurance reserve account over a three year period. To the extent that these settlement costs are less than the liability insurance premium paid by that unit over the same period, 50% of the surplus will be credited to the unit over a three-year period. To the extent that these settlements result in over funding of the reserve account, the surplus will be applied to lower the Aggregate Annual Premium charged across the University as described in the budget section above.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Arrangements</strong><br> Each department is responsible for making whatever arrangements are necessary to secure University facilities when they are not in use.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b.

                   <p><strong>a. Keys</strong><br> The number of people given keys to buildings, offices, labs, and storerooms should be kept to a minimum. A list of people with keys should be kept by each department. Keys must be returned upon termination of employment. Arrangements should be made to change keys and locks from time to time.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Safeguarding Equipment</strong><br> Each department is responsible for the inventory and safeguard of all valuable equipment. If equipment is loaned, a record should be kept of each temporary assignment. Portable equipment of value should be kept in locked storage when not in use if this can be arranged. Consideration should be given to bolting or chaining computers, microscopes, and similar equipment to the working surface. Contact the Police Department at 650/723-9633, or see <a href="http://police.stanford.edu">http://police.stanford.edu</a> for advice concerning security of property through the STOPP program. Monetary losses to the department may be reduced by implementation of the program and the $1,000 insurance deductible may be waived.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Valuable Papers and Records</strong><br> Special arrangements should be made for protecting valuable, irreplaceable, and confidential papers and records. Desks, file cabinets, and safes containing confidential or valuable documents must be locked whenever they are unattended, even for a short time. Consideration should be given to maintaining duplicate records, disks, tapes, or microfilms. Off-site storage should be arranged for valuable records. Such records should be kept current.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Safe Deposit Boxes</strong><br> If items are to be kept in a safe deposit box, the box should be rented in the name of Stanford University and fees billed to the University (not to an individual). Notification of the box location and authorized signatures should be sent to the Risk Management Office and the Accounting Officer, Controller's Office.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Money and Personal Property</strong><br> Employees should be reminded periodically not to leave cash, wallets, pocketbooks, or personal possessions of value in accessible locations. Personal automobiles should be locked.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Works of Art, Precious Metals, and Stones</strong><br> Whenever works of art, precious metals (such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, and rhenium), or valuable stones (diamonds, opals, sapphires, etc.), whose total value is significant are acquired by purchase, donation, or loan to the University, the department is responsible for providing an adequate security and accountability system. The Police Department and the Risk Management Office are available for assistance in developing an auditable system for the receipt, inventory, storage, and accountability of the precious items. A written description of procedures should be filed in the department. Departments accepting loans or gifts of such property should send a copy of the inventory to the Risk Management Office for insurance coverage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Vandalism</strong><br> Adequate protection against theft should provide equal protection against acts of vandalism. If physical facilities are such that unauthorized access is possible, departments may ask the advice of the Stanford Police for methods of obtaining adequate protection.</p>

This may be a faculty member or principal investigator, a department head, a university officer, or the university as a whole. The owner of the fund has the fiduciary responsibility for prudent management of fund balances. While at any time during the fiscal year a fund may go into deficit, by the end of the fiscal year, any fund with a deficit equal to or in excess of $1,000 in cash must be made whole by some other appropriate funding source.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Fund Accounting</strong><br> The University maintains its accounts in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. Because the University receives funding from a variety of sources, with different types of terms and restrictions, each source must be tracked as a separate accounting entity in a unique fund.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Restrictions on Use of Funds</strong><br> Fund restrictions are classified differently for internal and external reporting purposes.&nbsp; While some of the terms overlap, they have different meanings depending on the reporting context.&nbsp; For external reporting purposes, the definitions are based on generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp; For internal reporting purposes, the definitions are based on the use of the funds.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(1) Internal Reporting Definitions</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Restricted: </strong>When a donor makes a gift to the University, the donor may provide terms for the use of that gift.&nbsp; If the terms specify a particular purpose, the funds are restricted to that purpose.&nbsp; Income and appreciation produced by restricted endowments is also restricted as per the terms of the endowment.&nbsp; Funding provided by sponsored agencies or corporations for specific grant or contract work is also considered restricted.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Unrestricted:</strong> Funds without donor terms or with terms that allow the funds to be used anywhere at the University.&nbsp; If donor terms allow a gift to be used broadly within a school or unit, it is deemed Unrestricted at the unit level, but Restricted by central University administration.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Designated: </strong>These are unrestricted funds that have been designated for a specific purpose by the Board of Trustees or senior management.&nbsp; Internal units in the University can designate unrestricted resources to any number of specific purposes, but from a broader analytical perspective those funds are unrestricted for purposes of internal reporting.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(2) External Reporting Definitions</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Permanently Restricted: </strong>The University classifies as Permanently Restricted (a) the original value of gifts donated to the Endowment and (b) accumulations to the Endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Temporarily Restricted:</strong> Temporarily Restricted assets include gifts and pledges that are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that expire with the passage of time, payment of pledges, or specific actions to be undertaken by the University or the Hospitals; these assets are then released and reclassified as Unrestricted.&nbsp; In addition, appreciation and income on certain donor-restricted endowments funds are classified as Temporarily Restricted until authorized for spending.&nbsp; Donor-restricted resources intended for capital projects are initially recorded as Temporarily Restricted and released from their temporary restrictions and reclassified as Unrestricted when the asset is placed in service.&nbsp; Also included in this category is the University’s net equity in split interest agreements, expendable at maturity.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Unrestricted:</strong> Funds that are not Permanently Restricted or Temporarily Restricted are treated as Unrestricted for external reporting purposes.&nbsp; This includes expendable gifts that have donor restrictions, so long as the University is free to spend the gift.&nbsp; Funds Functioning as Endowment, or FFE, are University resources designated by the Board or internal University units to be held as endowment.&nbsp; FFE is usually considered Unrestricted per accounting rules, as are most other expendable resources in the University.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Chart of Accounts</strong><br> Stanford’s accounting system uses an alphanumeric code, or chart of accounts. The fund number, also referred to as the award number, is included in the chart of accounts.&nbsp; The University accounting system also records attributes assigned to each fund that further define the fund purpose and restrictions.&nbsp; For a detailed explanation of its structure, please see Stanford's <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/index.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Controller's Office, a unit in Financial Management Services (FMS), and the departments and individuals authorized to spend funds in an account share responsibility for using the chart of accounts appropriately. The Controller's Office is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the chart of accounts and for assigning fund and other account numbers. Schools and departments are responsible for communicating any restrictions on use of funds so that Controller's Office staff can set up the account correctly.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The University combines funds with similar characteristics into fund groups for budgeting, planning, and reporting purposes.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Expendable Resources</strong><br> Expendable resources are available for the current operation of the University; balances can be accumulated for future expenditure. Sources of funds include, but are not limited to, the following:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(1) Contracts and Grants</strong><br> Funds provided by sponsors to reimburse the direct costs of contracts and grants are restricted per internal reporting definitions. The terms of the award and applicable regulations determine how the money may be spent. To apply for a contract or grant the principal investigator for the project submits a proposal through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegate to the sponsor. OSR negotiates the award with the sponsor. For more information, see the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/topics/award-acceptance#Federal_Research_Terms_and_Conditions">OSR website</a>.<br> <br> <strong>(2) Tuition and Fees</strong><br> The Board of Trustees sets tuition and fee rates. The Student Financial Services Office collects tuition and fee payments from registered students each quarter. Income from tuition and fees is unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.<br> <br> <strong>(3) Gifts</strong><br> Donor gifts that are not ultimately directed to the endowment are usually considered expendable; exceptions include cases where the funds are not available for the current operation of the University, such as Pending funds and Donor Advised Funds.&nbsp; Donors typically specify the purpose of gifts, which will determine whether the gifts are assigned to expendable, capital, or endowed purposes. The Office of Development solicits and processes gifts to the University. For more information, see <a href="/chapter-4">Chapter 4</a>:&nbsp;Giving to Stanford.<br> <br> <strong>(4) Reimbursement of Facilities and Administrative Costs (Indirect Costs)</strong><br> The Cost and Management Analysis Office calculates&nbsp; rates that are charged to each contract and grant to pay for facilities and administrative overhead costs associated with sponsored research. These costs include utilities, building maintenance, and administrative support.&nbsp; The responsible agency for the federal government, which for Stanford is the Office of Naval Research (ONR), approves the rates. Indirect cost reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. Information on rate calculations and policy is available on the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/proposal-preparation-submission/rates">DoResearch</a> website.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>(5) Reimbursement of Facilities Costs (Infrastructure and Utilities Charges)</strong><br> Designated Funds and Restricted Funds that do not otherwise pay facilities-related costs (both Sponsored and Non-sponsored) are charged an infrastructure fee to offset operations, maintenance, and utilities costs paid by University unrestricted funds. The fee is a percentage of certain types of expenditures, and these reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. More information is available in <a href="/3-3-1">Guide Memo 3.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Infrastructure Charges.<br> <br> <strong>(6) Auxiliary Activities</strong><br> Auxiliaries are self-contained financial entities (see <a href="/3-1-3">Guide Memo 3.1.3</a>:&nbsp;Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)). Income is used to support operations, including overhead, and all income is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.<br> <br> <strong>(7) Special Program Fees &amp; Other Income</strong><br> Income from outside sources related to programs, patents and royalties, program activities, affiliations, ticket income and the like are collected throughout the institution.&nbsp; Much of this income is subject to the Infrastructure and Utilities Charge.&nbsp; All of it is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Endowment Funds</strong><br> Funds in the Endowment include:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>True Endowment:</strong><br> Endowment funds created pursuant to the terms of a donor’s gift.&nbsp; These funds are generally intended to last in perpetuity.&nbsp; Funds established with gifts directed to the endowment are typically used to purchase “pure” shares in the Merged Pool, and in rare circumstances are held in assets specifically directed by the donor.&nbsp; True Endowment and payout from True Endowment are considered restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The Board of Trustees establishes an annual payout rate for distributions from the University’s endowment funds.&nbsp; Payout may be made from True Endowment without limitation to income as long as the payout rate is prudently established and the gift terms do not provide otherwise. There is a group of funds referred to as “Pool A” funds that are established by gifts with terms that specify something like the following: “income but no appreciation” may be paid out of the fund. These types of funds are typically no longer established by the University. There are also funds that contain what are known as “Pool B Limited” shares. This situation arises where the donor specifies something like the following: only income and appreciation above the original gift value may be paid out. These types of funds are also typically no longer established by the University. Funds without such terms of limitation are referred to in the University accounting system as “Unlimited."<br> <br> Payout generated by a true endowment fund that cannot be used for operational purposes can be redirected back to the principal of the fund for investment if provided for in the donor's gift agreement, or at the request of an internal University unit.&nbsp; When the funds are reinvested pursuant to a provision in the donor’s gift agreement, they add “pure” shares to the Endowment; when they are reinvested at the request of an internal unit they add “quasi” shares to the Endowment. In both cases, reinvestment takes place at year end unless the provision in the donor's gift agreement specifically provides that all payout be reinvested until the True Endowment fund reaches a certain level, in which case reinvestment is made monthly. All such reinvestment is subject to the same donor terms as the original Endowment gift, and is restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose. Any reinvestment of unused payout by an internal University unit must be requested by July 31 for the given fiscal year.<br> <br> For True Endowment funds that contain Pool B Limited shares, payout is limited to income and appreciation in any year. Withdrawals in excess of income and appreciation are only permitted if that fund also contains quasi shares, in which case up to the full value of all quasi shares can be sold to make the full regular payout for that year (or as much of the full regular payout as possible).&nbsp; Requests for such withdrawals must be made by July 31 for the given fiscal year; refer to the form <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/endowment/withdawal_guidelines_true_endowment.pdf" target="_blank">Withdrawal Guidelines for True Endowment</a>.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Funds Functioning as Endowment (or Quasi-Endowment Funds):</strong><br> Funds Functioning as Endowment (FFE) are expendable resources (both restricted and unrestricted per internal reporting definitions) that are invested in the Merged Pool (MP) and are considered part of the University’s Endowment.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">These are created at the request of an internal University unit (department, school, etc.). In order to create a new FFE, the unit must invest a minimum of $1 million. The minimum addition of “new” money to an existing FFE is $250,000. The University’s Chief Financial Officer and Provost are jointly authorized to make an exception to these minimums. Requests to create FFE must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school’s or unit’s Senior Financial Officer. Requests to approve the creation of FFE involving gift funding must be reviewed by the Office of Planned Giving.</span></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;">To optimize investment returns, the University takes a long term perspective of its investments in the MP which requires minimal unplanned cash flow volatility in the portfolio.&nbsp; Thus, the MP should not be used by individual fundholders to support short term needs.&nbsp; Accordingly, FFE invested in the MP these funds are subject to the following guidelines:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong><u>Lock-up Periods:</u></strong></p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 120px;"> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Any FFE investment made on or after September 1, 2016, is subject to a 7-year initial “lock-up” period, during which it cannot be redeemed.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Any FFE investment made prior to September 1, 2016 is subject to the previous 5-year initial “lock-up” period, during which it cannot be redeemed.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong><u>Annual Withdrawal Limits:</u></strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Once the “lock-up” period is met, FFE can be withdrawn under the following conditions:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 120px;"> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">FFE invested on or after September 1, 2016 are subject to an annual withdrawal limit, which is the greater of: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li style="margin-left: 40px;">$5 million, or</li> 
                      <li style="margin-left: 40px;">10% of an individual fund’s market value. The 10% limit will be calculated as 10% of the fund’s market value which is eligible for withdrawal at the time the request is made, less any amount that has been redeemed or is pending redemption during the same fiscal year.</li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">FFE invested prior to September 1, 2016 are governed by the previous FFE policy, and are not subject to an annual withdrawal limit.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong><u>Required Approvals:</u></strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Withdrawals are also subject to the following approval authority:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 120px;"> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Withdrawals <strong>in keeping with these guidelines</strong></strong> may be transferred out of the endowment with the approval of the school financial officer, the University Chief Financial Officer and the Provost. Smaller amounts may be withdrawn only if the remaining balance is being withdrawn.</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Withdrawals outside these guidelines </strong>are not typically allowed and extraordinary exceptions require an action of the Board of Trustees.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong><u>Notification Periods:</u></strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;">In order to provide the Stanford Management Company with sufficient time to divest assets, requests for withdrawals must be received by Fund Accounting based on the following minimum notification requirements prior to anticipated month of withdrawal:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 120px;"> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Up to $150 million – 90 days</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">$150 million-$250 million – 150 days</li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Greater than $250 million – 270 days</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Please refer to the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/FFE.pdf">"Investment and Withdrawal Guidelines for Funds Functioning as Endowment Greater than $500,000"</a> form for further details.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><strong><u>Reinvestment of Payout:</u></strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Even if the amount is less than the minimum for new principal investments, at the request of the creating unit, all unused payout from FFE may automatically be reinvested back in to the principal of the fund at year end; this election can only be made upon the formation of the fund or when additions of $500,000 or more are made to the fund. If a unit chooses not to request the automatic year end reinvestment, they may contact Fund Accounting by July 31 to specify the amount that should be reinvested for the given fiscal year.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(3) Term Endowments:</strong> Endowment created at the request of a donor, but intended to be fully spent down on a timeline established by the donor. These monies are used to purchase “quasi” shares in the Endowment. Regular withdrawals are made as per the donor terms.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c.&nbsp; Non-Endowment Funds invested in the Merged Pool</strong><br> Funds in this group include, but are not limited to:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(1) Life Income Gifts:</strong> A life income gift allows donors to give assets to Stanford while providing themselves or others with income for a period of time before Stanford is permitted to use the gift; until that period has ended, the gift is not counted as part of the University Endowment. The university, as trustee, manages the investment of the assets and pays a specified income to the donor, the donor’s designated beneficiaries, or both. Income payments continue for the beneficiaries' lives or, in some cases, for a term of up to 20 years.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(2) Donor Advised Funds:</strong> Stanford has Donor Advised Funds. For more information on the size and type of gifts required to create a Donor Advised Fund at Stanford, and the amount of the fund that must ultimately be designated for the use of the University, please refer to <a href="http://giving.stanford.edu/planned-giving/giving-options/donor-advised-funds">the Office of Development’s website</a>. In cases where all or part of a Donor Advised Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor’s request.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>(3) Pending Funds:</strong> These are gifts where the purpose is pending final designation by the donor and the university. In cases where all or part of a Pending Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor’s request.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>d. Student Loan Funds</strong><br> Student Loan Funds are not meant to be expensed, but rather are loaned to students as a portion of the financial aid package. As these loans are repaid, the principal and accumulated interest become available for new student loans.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>e. Plant Funds</strong><br> Plant Funds are funds that have been received or designated by the Trustees for facilities and retirement of indebtedness. They also include all of the University's investments in long-lived capital assets and related liabilities.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>f. Agency Funds</strong><br> These are funds held for others, with Stanford acting as the custodian. Funds in this group represent liabilities owed by the University.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Fund transfers are accounting entries that move all, or a portion of, a fund's balance to another fund. The appropriateness of a fund transfer is dependent on the characteristics of the source and destination funds, including the type of fund, the restrictions of the fund, whether the source and destination fund share the same infrastructure and EFP (Expendable Funds Pool) treatment, etc. Generally, fund transfers are allowed when the characteristics of the source and destination funds conform to one another and the terms of each fund does not preclude such a transfer. These transfers are used to:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Move money between designated funds or between restricted funds (generally transfers between a restricted fund and a designated fund are not allowed, nor are transfers to/from a sponsored project fund)</li> 
                    <li>Transfer money into or between plant funds</li> 
                    <li>Allocate and reallocate general (unrestricted) funds among budget units</li> 
                    <li>Increase or decrease restricted funds’ support of an Operating Budget account</li>

                   <p>As transfer of funding creates an initial disconnect between where the funds were collected and where they were used (appropriated), strong controls and audit trails of fund transfers are required by the University and is responsible business practice.</p>

                    <p>The University's Oracle Financial system has two core accounting applications: Grants Accounting (GA) and General Ledger (GL). The GA subledger records all detailed expenditure transactions and then summarizes them in the GL. The GA module has five segments: Project (P), Task (T), Award (A), Expenditure types (E) and Organization. A Project (P) is an activity or event with a single purpose. A Task (T) is a further breakdown of the project; every project has at least one task. An Award (A) is a funding source for a particular project or task.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> Operating Budget PTAs are the primary PTAs for the University's core academic programs and support services. Operating Budget PTAs are used to record accounting transactions for these core activities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> At the beginning of the fiscal year, Operating Budget PTAs receive money only from University unrestricted funds and from appropriate departmental designated funds, gift funds, and endowment income funds (see <a href="/3-1-2">Guide Memo 3.1.2</a>:&nbsp;University Funds). Changes in funding during the year may be made online by authorized budget officers.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> The Fund Accounting department of the Controller's Office sets up and maintains PTAs funded from the University's Operating Budget. To request a new Operating Budget P, T, and/or A, a person who has organizational authority submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office. The form is located at Stanford's <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/forms.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a>.&nbsp;<br> For step-by-step instructions, see <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html">Quick Steps: Request New PTA</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> At fiscal year end (August 31), all unused restricted funds that are held in an Operating Budget Award must be returned to their original source fund. If expenditures have exceeded the Expense Control, other sources of funding must be identified to cover the deficit. If there are still budgeted funds available, work with the University's Budget Office to determine how to handle these funds.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Closing an Operating Budget PTA</strong><br> At any time, a department may send a memo to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office requesting that an Operating Budget P, T, and/or A be closed to expense. The P, T, and/or A will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="grant-and-contract-pta"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Grant and Contract PTA</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> A grant or contract fund and related expenditure PTA(s) are used to record accounting transactions for a sponsored project. The <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/definitions-and-types-agreements/gift-vs-sponsored-projects-and-distinctions-other-forms-funding">Research Policy Handbook 13.1</a>, sets out criteria for determining if external support for a project should be handled as a sponsored project. Note that external support that does not meet these criteria is handled as a gift.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> A grant or contract fund receives money from the agency sponsoring the research, instruction, or other sponsored activity at the University. Proposals for grants and contracts are processed through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegates. Additional information is available at the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/fiscal-responsibilities-principal-investigators/preparation-and-submission-proposal-budgets">DoResearch</a> website.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> When a grant or contract has been awarded, OSR assigns a fund (award) number for the sponsored project, and sets up related Project(s) and Task(s) as requested. OSR handles any subsequent accounting system maintenance during the life of the award. OSR also receives awards for student aid directly from a school or from the Graduate Financial Aids Office. The form used to request a PTA is located <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#early-pta-setup">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Early Accounts</strong><br> For the effective and economical conduct of a sponsored project, it is sometimes necessary for costs to be incurred before the award document has been received. In such cases, departments should request that OSR set up an early PTA. The "Authorization for Early Project Task and Award Request" form is available online <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/how-to/open-early-pta">here</a>.<br> The early PTA becomes the permanent PTA when the award is effective; no cost transfers are needed. Pre-award costs must be charged to a pre-award account and may not be placed on an unrelated award and later transferred to the benefiting PTA.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Ongoing PTA Management </strong><br> <strong>(1) Allowability of Expenditures</strong><br> The Principal Investigator (PI) is accountable for the accuracy, allowability, allocability, appropriateness and timely review of charges to a grant or contract PTA (or a related cost sharing PTA) and for ensuring that expenditures do not exceed the level authorized by the award. See Guide Memos:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><a href="/3-1-4">3.1.4</a>:&nbsp;Cost Policy</li> 
                    <li><a href="/3-2-1">3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures</li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Approvals</strong><br> The terms of the award and governing cost principles may require approval from the agency for such actions as rebudgeting funds, travel, or purchasing capital equipment. OSR processes approval requests.<br> <strong>(3) Review</strong><br> The PI or someone else knowledgeable about the sponsored project must review the PTA each month, bringing any questionable items to the PI for decision on any needed action. Review guidance and tools are available at <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/project-management/monthly-review-and-quarterly-pi-review-and-certification">DoResearch</a>. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure report.<br> <strong>(4) Suballocations</strong><br> A suballocation of a grant or contract may be set up to handle accounting for:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>A subcontract</li> 
                    <li>Separate portions of the work</li> 
                    <li>Fabrication of capital equipment</li> 
                    <li>A conference associated with the project: This is usually accomplished by setting up additional Tasks within the Project, linked to the appropriate award(s).</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>f. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> Accounting records for grant and contract PTAs are closed for reporting purposes at fiscal year end. The entire budget and all expenditures for the period of the award are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure reports.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Closing a Grant or Contract PTA</strong><br> <strong>(1) Definition</strong><br> Closeout is the administrative process whereby sponsors determine whether all technical and administrative requirements of the grant or contract have been completed. Sponsored projects are considered completed or "closed out" only after the sponsor receives and approves all technical, financial, invention and property reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award and notifies Stanford of its acceptance and signoff.<br> <strong>(2) Principal Investigator's Responsibilities</strong><br> At the close of a grant or contract, the Principal Investigator is accountable for ensuring that the expenses recorded are complete, allowable, allocable, and without overdrafts. For more information, see <a href="/3-2-2">Guide Memo 3.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Cost Transfers, and the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-transfer-policy-sponsored-projects">Research Policy Handbook 15.8</a>&nbsp;Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Projects.<br> <strong>(3) Office of Sponsored Research Responsibilities</strong><br> OSR prepares the final financial reports and performs a review. Generally, the final financial report is due 90 days after the end of the award.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="cost-sharing-pta"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Cost-Sharing PTA</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> Cost sharing represents that portion of the total project costs of a sponsored agreement borne by the University, rather than the sponsor. The <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy">Research Policy Handbook&nbsp;15.3</a> states the University's policy on cost sharing. Separate PTAs must be established to track committed cost sharing. This is usually accomplished by setting up a cost sharing Task in the Project that holds the sponsored project, and linking it to a cost-sharing award.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> The Principal Investigator must identify and provide resources to fund the cost-sharing PTA. Funds from other federal awards may not be used as the source of cost sharing except as authorized by statute. Funds generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> The notice of award prepared by OSR and the signed award document indicate if the project involves cost sharing. OSR will not open the sponsored PTA until the related cost-sharing PTA is opened. When a cost-sharing PTA is required, a person with signature authority over the fund from which the cost-sharing PTA will be funded or guaranteed sends a copy of the cost-sharing budget and the Cost-Sharing Authorization form to OSR requesting the PTA be opened. For information on how to set up a sponsored PTA, see the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#cost-sharing-pta-setup">DoResearch</a> website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Ongoing PTA Management</strong><br> Cost-sharing PTAs are subject to the same PTA management procedures as described above for grant and contract PTAs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> Cost-sharing PTAs must be fully funded at the end of the University's fiscal year. Cost-sharing budgets and expenditures carry over to the new fiscal year, as described above for grant and contract PTAs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Closing a Cost Sharing PTA</strong><br> The cost-sharing PTA is closed at the same time as the related grant or contract account, as described above.</p> 
                  </div>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> A gift PTA is used to record the expenditures that execute the purpose of the gift.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> The source of money for a gift fund may be a single gift or multiple gifts that have a common purpose and any related income generated by the gift itself or its associated endowment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> When a gift is received whose terms require the opening of a separate fund, the Department submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to their school/department Fund Accountant in the Controller's Office. They must also fax copies of the donor documentation and a Gift Transmittal Form to their fund accountant. The original donor correspondence regarding the restricted purpose of the gift and the original Gift Transmittal along with the donor check should be sent to Gift Processing. Never hold a donor check while waiting for a PTA. Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund/award number and sets up the related expenditure Project and Task(s). Fund Accounting creates the Fund Authorization document that describes the purpose of the fund. If the gift creates a new endowment fund, Fund Accounting sets up a related expendable endowment income fund to receive the endowment income. The form used to request a new Gift PTA is located at <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#forms-to-setup-or-modify-existing-ptas">here</a>.</p> 
                   <p>For step-by-step instructions, see<a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html"> Quick Steps: Request New PTA </a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> At fiscal year end the balance of the gift fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in an expendable gift fund or an endowment income fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund restricted to departmental use must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Closing a Gift PTA<br> (1) Endowment</strong><br> Endowment gift funds and their related endowment income funds are very seldom closed. In the event that a PTA funded by an endowment income fund needs to be closed, the department should contact Fund Accounting. The account will be closed the first of the next month.<br> <strong>(2) Expendable Gift PTAs</strong><br> At any time during the year, departments may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a PTA for an expendable gift fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> Designated funds generally contain unrestricted funds that the University (rather than a donor or sponsoring agency) has decided to use for a specific purpose.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> There are two sorts of designated funds:<br> (1) General funds that have been transferred to a department for a specific purpose, such as departmental research support.<br> (2) Income that has been generated by the department and designated for departmental use. Examples are fees from professional services and conferences.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> To open a designated fund and related expenditure account, the department sends an email and Fund Accounting PTA Request Form to their school/department Fund Accounting. The form used to request a new PTA is located <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#forms-to-setup-or-modify-existing-ptas">here</a>. &nbsp;Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund (award) number and sets up the related Project and Task(s) with the Fund Authorization information. For step-by-step instructions, see <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html">Quick Steps: Request New PTA</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Changes to Fund Balances </strong><br> <strong>(1)</strong> Designated funds funded by general funds transfers are increased only by transfers from other University designated or unrestricted funds. That is, income cannot be deposited to this kind of fund.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> Designated funds holding income are increased as cash receipts are deposited or transferred from other University designated or unrestricted funds.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> At fiscal year end the balance of the designated fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in a designated fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Closing a Designated Fund PTA </strong><br> At any time during the year, the department may send an email to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A for a designated fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> Capital Asset projects capture expenditures related to facilities and infrastructure projects or computer hardware or software systems that require capitalization. They allow the University to categorize expenditures as capital assets or expenses and to collect expenditures in a way that supports indirect cost recovery, service center rate development and financial reporting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> Multiple sources of funding may support a specific capital project. Examples are gifts, departmental funds, University unrestricted funds, University facilities reserves, debt, and Stanford Infrastructure Program funds.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> A department planning a facilities construction or renovation project works with &nbsp;<a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/">Land, Buildings and Real Estate</a> (LBRE)/Department of Capital Planning to initiate the project via the <a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/form_1_system">Facilities Form 1 System</a>. When the project receives approval, a copy of the Facilities Form I and PTA set-up form is submitted to the Capital Accounting section of the Controller's Office. Capital Accounting reviews the Form 1 for necessary approvals, appropriateness of sources of funding and fund availability. It also sets up the PTA and sends out an Authorization memo, which includes the appropriate capital PTA, authorized budget, and applicable asset code for the project, notifying the appropriate individuals so they can grant signature authority on the PTA, as needed. For step-by-step instructions, see <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html">Quick Steps: Request New PTA</a>.</p> 
                   <p>For capital asset projects that do not involve facilities (e.g., computer hardware or software systems) the <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/forms.html">Capital Projects PTA Request Form</a> should be completed and sent to Capital Accounting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Mid-Project Changes</strong><br> If changes are needed to source of funds, the department informs Capital Accounting. Once funds are committed via the Form I, the department may not withdraw the funding commitment. However, a substitution of one fund source for another can be made.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> At fiscal year end the entire budget and expenditures for the project are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure statements. Expenditures must be fully funded. The department must work with Capital Accounting throughout the year to cover overdrafts.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Closing a Capital Project</strong><br> The project manager informs Capital Accounting that a project has been completed. Capital Accounting reconciles outstanding commitments, closes the project and award, and returns any unexpended funds to their original source.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> Auxiliary enterprises are self-supporting entities that support the University's teaching and research mission. They service principally faculty, students, staff and the Stanford community. Major University auxiliaries include Housing and Dining Services, Stanford University Press, and the Department of Athletics.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Source of Funds</strong><br> The source of funds for auxiliary PTAs is the income generated by the auxiliary activity. The amount budgeted for the fiscal year is based on a forecast of expected income and expenses for the year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Setting Up</strong><br> To set up a new auxiliary account, the department sends a memo to Fund Accounting with the appropriate information.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> A service center is an organizational unit of the University that provides a specific service, group of services, or products to users principally within the University. Large service centers include Information Technology Services (ITS), Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE), and the Medical School's Veterinary Service Center. Smaller service centers are typically found within academic departments. Detailed information on Service Centers is available at <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/office-research-administration-research-administration-policy-and-compliance">DoResearch</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Authorization</strong><br> Proposals for a new service center must have the approval of the department chair and school dean, or their equivalent for nonacademic areas. The Office of Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) is responsible for setting service center policy and reviewing annual budget submissions which should include the volume projection for services, and ensure the costs are compliant with Federal as well as University regulations. Review the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/service-center-manual" target="_blank">Service Center Manual</a> for additional information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Annual Breakeven</strong><br> All service centers must annually break even, unless ONR has granted an exception. Twelve months of operational expense should be allocated to users via twelve months of allocation journals. If the year-end under-recovery exceeds 5% of expenses including the prior year balance for administrative service centers or 15% for academic service centers then either the users are charged the under-recovered amount or the service center's department will need to subsidize the entire loss. If the year-end over-recovery exceeds the 5% or 15% limit, a rebate must be allocated to all users of the service center. The breakeven calculation is fully explained <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/service-center-manual/policies-and-practices/service-center-policies">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Source of Funds</strong><br> The costs of service center services or products are charged directly to all users based on the actual level of activity using a nondiscriminatory rate schedule. This rate schedule (the service center rate) must be calculated to recover no more or no less than the estimated aggregate cost of the service or product over a fiscal year unless otherwise agreed upon by the federal government.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Setting Up</strong><br> When a new service center is reviewed and approved by RAPC, RAPC will open a new PTA. Some of the information required to open a new service center includes the purpose of the service center, anticipated usage, list of anticipated internal and external users, estimated initial budget, list of capital assets that will be required for the service center operation and a valid Guarantee PTA account. All academic service centers must have a guarantee account, which can be an operating budget, Dean's Executive fund, or unrestricted gift PTA designated by the school dean or department head. See the "<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html#request_service_ctr">Request for Establishing a New Service Center</a>" PTA setup document.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Mid-Year Changes</strong><br> Requests to change a service center rate should be made as soon as it appears an administrative service center will not break even within +/-5% at year-end or an academic service center will not break even within +/-15% at year-end using the previously approved rates. Such requests much be routed to the appropriate service center analyst for review and approval before the new rate can be used. <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/research-administration-policy-and-compliance-rapc#service-centers" target="_blank">A list of service center analysts</a> is available online.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Fiscal Year End</strong><br> Service center balances at fiscal year end must be within +/- 5% of an administrative service center's annual expenditures, including the prior year balance and +/- 15% of an academic service center's annual expenditures, including prior year balances. When any over-recovery exceeds break-even percentage, the entire surplus balance must be refunded to all users in an equitable manner. When any under-recovery exceeds the applicable percentage, the entire deficit balance must be cleared either by either charging the service center's Guarantee PTA or by allocating a yearend assessment of the entire loss to all users on a prorated usage basis. Service centers that operate under special long-term break-even or pricing agreements with the government will not be required to break even at year-end.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Closing a Service Center PTA</strong><br> The department will need to clear any remaining balance before RAPC can close the service center PTA.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> An expenditure allocation (expense clearing) PTA is a departmental expenditure PTA used to accumulate specific costs as a means of expediting the processing of accounting transactions. Expenditure allocation PTAs are used when the final distribution of expenses is unknown at the time the expenses are incurred. Expenditure allocation PTAs are cleared via iJournals or Labor Distribution adjustments. Labor and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If labor and material expenses must be combined, the department should establish a service center PTA (see section 9). For related information, see <a href="/3-2-3">AGM 3.2.3: Allocation and Offsets</a>. Please refer to the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/">DoResearch </a>site for additional guidance on the use of expenditure allocation PTAs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Authorization</strong><br> Expenditure allocation PTAs must have the approval of the requesting department's Administrative Service Manager and an individual with financial authority over the guarantee PTA.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Source of Funds</strong><br> The requesting department must identify and provide resources to guarantee the expenditure allocation PTA. Funds from sponsored awards may not be used as the guarantee. Guarantees generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds. The fund source will be used to guarantee any uncleared expenses at the end of the fiscal year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Setting Up</strong><br> When a department needs a new expenditure allocation PTA it requests Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) to set it up by submitting the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/documents/expenditure-allocation-pta-request-form/download">Request For Expenditure Allocation PTA form</a>. RAPC will review the allocation method(s) to be used by the account administrator and maintain records to support the establishment of the PTA.</p>

                   <p>One-third of all funding for University expenditures comes from the federal government. Most of this funding comes in the form of direct support for sponsored projects, but a substantial portion comes in the form of reimbursement for indirect costs of federally sponsored grants and contracts. Stanford tracks whether University activities are allowable for reimbursement using the Project, Task and Award (PTA) to which transactions are charged, and tracks allowable and unallowable cost objects through the Expenditure Type used to record transactions.</p>

In many cases, the issue of whether a particular cost is allowable is a complex one. When in doubt, consult with your local financial or research administrator, the Office of Sponsored Research or Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS). All unallowable activities and objects (line items) must be coded as such. In general, expenses are chargeable to the federal government only if they are:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Reasonable</strong><br> A prudent person would have purchased this item and paid this price.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Allocable</strong><br> Expenses can be allocated to the government activity based on benefit derived, cause and effect, or other equitable relationship.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Consistently Treated</strong><br> Like expenses must be treated the same in like circumstances.</li>

                   </ul> 
                   <p>If an expense cannot meet the above criteria, it is not eligible to be charged to a federal grant or contract no matter what its purpose.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Note:</strong> Agencies that sponsor grants and contracts use the term allowable to mean permitted as a direct cost under the terms of a specific grant or contract.

                   <p>Retaining records serves two purposes. In the short-term, it provides those responsible for the management of accounts with the means to monitor transactions and resolve problems. In the long-term, it enables the University to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service regulations, and other federal, state and local regulations governing auditability and retention of records.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Online Transactions</strong><br> When the source documentation for a transaction is online, the central administrative office responsible for maintaining the online application is responsible for retaining the online transaction record.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Paper Documents</strong><br> When the source documentation for a transaction is paper, the office that receives the original document is responsible for retaining it. The submitting department is responsible for retaining the support until the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report. Originating departments have the responsibility to destroy any paper backup once central administration has successfully processed the reimbursement request, has a copy of the scanned supporting documentation and the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong><br> <strong>1) </strong>For Federal contracts, a copy of the original paper copy must be retained for one year past the date it was scanned;<br> <strong>2)</strong> either a paper copy or scanned copy of the monthly grant and contract expenditure statements or quarterly certification statement signed by the principal investigator and task manager should be retained by the department in accordance with the "Direct Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants" retention policy.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Minimum Paper and Electronic Record Retention Times<br> Legal and Audit Requirements</strong><br> When requirements for long-term retention of records overlap, the responsible office should retain records for the maximum period needed to meet legal and audit requirements. In special cases retention times may be extended by request of the central offices. In such a situation the affected will be notified in writing. General rules:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records</strong>: Life of the bond issue, plus the life of any issue that refunds the issue, plus six years. Records related to tax-exempt debt include but are not limited to documentation of the use of the debt proceeds (project costs), how debt financed property is used, relevant sponsored research contracts and grants in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt, relevant third party leases of space, etc. Detailed information can be found under the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/bond_taxExempt_guidelines.pdf">Compliance Guidelines for Tax-Exempt Bonds</a>.&nbsp;</li>

                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Direct Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants</strong>: Four years following the end date of the award (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above).</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Transactions involving depreciable assets</strong>: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>Moveable equipment records (not financed with tax-exempt debt) will be centrally retained three years beyond the disposal of the asset.</li> 
                      <li>Transaction records involving other depreciable assets will be retained six years beyond the asset becoming fully depreciated (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above.)</li> 
                     </ul> </li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Business Transaction Records</strong> (not contract or grant-related): Four years.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Employee Payroll Information</strong>: Six years from retirement or termination.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Taxable Income</strong> (Cash receipt information and billings, and all documents for activities considered unrelated business income. See <a href="/1-5-3">Guide Memo 1.5.3</a>:&nbsp;Unrelated Business Activity). Four years following the end of the fiscal year. Longer retention times apply to certain documents retained by central offices. For information on a specific document or category of documents, the office responsible for the type of transaction should consult the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR), Research Financial Compliance and Services, or Financial Management Services (FMS) consisting of the Controller's Office, Office of the Treasurer, Procurement (including Accounts Payable, Travel &amp; Reimbursements), Global Services, and Consulting &amp; Support.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Management Information</strong><br> When a central office has retention responsibility, the department initiating a transaction may discard copies of documentation supporting the transaction when it is no longer needed for management purposes. For example, when the transaction is complete and the expenditure statement containing the transaction has been reviewed. At its discretion, a department may keep copies of documents for longer periods.</p>

See <a href="/6-4-1">Guide Memo 6.4.1</a>:&nbsp;Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In addition to these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specific authentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of the authentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of an employee's hand-written signature and may be used as an "electronic signature" in electronic applications.</p> 
                   <h3><strong>d. Signature Security</strong></h3> 
                   <p>Only the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically. Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name of another person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authentication information to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilities for handling authentication information are described in<a href="/6-4-1"> Guide Memo 6.4.1</a>:&nbsp;Identification and Authentication Systems.</p> 
                   <h3>e. Limitations on Signature Authority</h3> 
                   <h4>(1) Expense Reimbursement</h4> 
                   <p>No person may approve his or her own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual to whom he or she reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, must have the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management of the PTA or a properly delegated agent.</p> 
                   <h4>(2) Independent Review</h4> 
                   <p>Business expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President or the Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independent reviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees in an office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.</p> 
                   <h4>(3) Salaries</h4> 
                   <p>No person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects his or her own salary, or payroll/personnel forms that affect the salary of an individual to whom he or she reports either directly or indirectly.</p> 
                   <h4>(4) Conflict of Interest</h4> 
                   <p>No person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. See<a href="/1-5-2"> Guide Memo 1.5.2</a>: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.</p> 
                   <h3>f. Revoking Signature Authority</h3> 
                   <p>The University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsible to ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers to another department or leaves the University, his/her authority is automatically revoked. Changes for other operational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager.

                   <h3>a. Departmental Review</h3> 
                   <p>The deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom funds are allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operating statements to assure that:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Any expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.</li> 
                    <li>Charges are correct.</li> 
                    <li>Charges are allowable for the PTA.</li> 
                    <li>Charges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect cost rate calculations.</li> 
                    <li>Charges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).</li> 
                    <li>Any allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.</li> 
                    <li>Charges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmental accounts.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h3>b. Evidence of Review</h3> 
                   <p>Review of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.</p> 
                   <h3>c. Responsibility for Error Correction</h3> 
                   <p>The department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in <a href="/3-2-2">Guide Memo 3.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Cost Transfers, and the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy">Research Policy Handbook 15.3,</a> &nbsp;Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular time limits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good or service must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.</p> 
                   <h3>d. Central Office Review</h3> 
                   <p>To supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research review University selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing office directs the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office may correct the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <h3>a. Conformity to External Restrictions — Sponsored Research</h3> 
                   <p>Expenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant or cooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200, Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government. Please see the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/office-sponsored-research-osr"><u>DoResearch</u></a> website for more information: <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing">http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing </a>Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as the sponsored project that they support.</p> 
                   <h3>b. Monthly Review of Charges</h3> 
                   <p>For sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed each month, as noted in <a href="/3-1-3">Guide Memo 3.1.3</a>: Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The review should include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliation tools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must be completed within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must be reviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures, but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).</p> 
                   <h3>c. Quarterly Certification of Charges</h3> 
                   <p>The following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects and cost-sharing tasks each month:</p> 
                   <p>"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, all expenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accounting system. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the last day of month being reviewed.</p> 
                   <p>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S<br> Signature___________________________Date_____________<br> &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>PROJECT TASK MANAGER’S<br> Signature___________________________Date_____________"<br> <br> Quarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegate the monthly review of statements for accuracy, but <strong>may not delegate</strong> certification of the appropriateness of the charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project task manager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principal investigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of the end of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/project-management/monthly-review-and-quarterly-pi-review-and-certification">Monthly Review and Quarterly PI Review Certification</a>. This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed all direct charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonably accurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries to correct any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlined on the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu" target="_blank">DoResearch </a>site.</p> 
                   <h3>d. Record Retention</h3> 
                   <p>The certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by government and University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects (see <a href="/3-1-5">Guide Memo 3.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Retention of Financial Records.</p>

                   <h3>a. Conformity to Donor Restrictions — Gifts</h3> 
                   <p>Gifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work, budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use is consistent with the donor’s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care to allocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity as stipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specific expenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a report on line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose has not, however, been spent according to the donor’s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind and recoup the gifted funds.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>A cost transfer is an after-the-fact reallocation of the cost associated with a transaction from one Project-Task-Award (PTA) to another. Although costs should always be charged to the correct PTA, cost transfers are sometimes necessary. To be allowable, cost transfers must be timely, be fully documented, conform to University and sponsor allowability standards (that is, allowable under the terms of the sponsored agreement), and have appropriate authorizing signatures. See <a href="/3-2-1">Guide Memo 3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Error Correction</strong><br> Correction of errors is required on all PTAs. Errors may include clerical errors (such as typographical errors or transposition of digits in the PTA and expenditure types). Other errors may be detected upon review or certification of monthly expenditure reports. It may be that an employee's Labor Schedule was not updated, an individual's effort was redirected, or a purchase was charged to a PTA other than the one that ultimately benefited from the use of the items purchased. All errors should be corrected as soon as they are detected.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Active Sponsored Project PTAs</strong><br> Refer to <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy" target="_blank">Cost Sharing</a> in the Research Policy Handbook, Section 15.3. In addition to deadlines, it addresses:</p>

                    <li>Sponsor requirements</li>

                    <li>Costs benefiting more than one project</li> 
                    <li>Overdrafts</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Documentation</strong><br> Online cost transfer documentation must clearly show:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The expense directly benefits the receiving PTA</li> 
                    <li>The expense is allowable on the receiving PTA</li> 
                    <li>The reason the expense was charged incorrectly to the first PTA</li> 
                    <li>The allocation methodology used if transferring expenses to multiple PTAs</li> 
                    <li>That any systematic reasons which might cause this problem to be repeated have been addressed</li> 
                    <li>The reason for any delay in the timely processing of the transfer</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Cost Transfer Deadlines</strong><br> Cost transfers should be prepared and submitted as soon as the need for a transfer is identified, and should be completed no later than six months after the cost is posted. Transfers submitted after the deadline <em><strong>must</strong></em> include a valid reason for the delay, and will generally not be allowed to be transferred onto a sponsored project. When transfers are delayed, a correction to the original source of an entry (e.g., an update to a Labor Schedule) may not be made timely. Therefore, care should also be taken to ensure that subsequent charges are either appropriate to the original PTA or also transferred.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>An expense allocation is a method that enables apportionment of a particular expense or expenses to Projects-Tasks-Awards (PTAs) that specifically benefit from those charges. Allocations are used in situations where it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each PTA for a shared supply or service. They are used to distribute expenses to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from expenditure allocation PTAs (formerly knows as "clearing accounts") or service centers. They may also be used to distribute costs between benefiting PTAs when a purchase was originally charged to one PTA and one or more other PTAs also benefited from the purchase. Allocations are also used to distribute charges from independent systems (known as "feeders") into the financial system. Often allocations are repetitive or are required on a regular basis.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Expenditure Allocation PTA Definition</strong><br> An expenditure allocation PTA, as described in <a href="/3-1-3">Guide Memo 3.1.3</a>:&nbsp;Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)&nbsp;is a special PTA in which charges for materials, supplies, services, or salaries are accumulated, and then allocated each month to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Salary and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If salary and material expenses must be combined, a service center must be used. Sponsored project PTAs may not be used as expenditure allocation PTAs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Allocation Basis</strong><br> The basis of allocation/distribution (e.g., effort, square footage, headcount) must logically relate to the type of costs being allocated. It must produce an allocation to each activity/account in reasonable proportion to the benefits received. The allocation methodology must produce a result that is allowable, allocable, reasonable and consistent. Feeder systems typically charge other departments based on usage or services provided at specified rates. Administrative expenses may not be distributed or rotated among sponsored agreements. Departments shall not use any type of pooled allocation method to charge expenses to federal sponsored agreements except from a service center with approved rates, or as described in the Research Policy Handbook. Training is provided in the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/training/research-administration">Understanding Cost Policy class</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Documentation</strong><br> Online expense allocation documentation must clearly show the nature of the cost being allocated. The originator of the journal must include comments about the distribution basis in the online documentation and retain documentation of the allocation methodology and calculation results in accordance with the government and University's record retention requirements. Feeder systems track the charges and maintain documentation in their own systems.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Approvals</strong><br> Before an allocation journal or feeder is submitted to the financial system, the department processing the journal/feeder must have received approval from an authorized individual for each PTA charged. Certain feeder transactions, such as utility charges, are approved implicitly as part of the annual budget process. Approval for other allocations and feeders can be a "blanket" approval for regular ongoing costs allocated in a consistent manner. Approval can be evidenced in writing in a memo, on a request form (e.g., SU-13 or similar form) or via electronic means. The department originating the journal/feeder must maintain documentation of written approval. For allocation journals, written approval must be on file from individuals with signature authority over the PTAs being charged, while online approval is required for the PTA or Project-Fund-Object being credited. The originator of the journal attests to the following when creating the allocation journal:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>This allocation is being processed in accordance with policy</li> 
                    <li>The cost is an appropriate charge to the PTAs sharing the expense</li> 
                    <li>The PTA actually benefited from the cost of the goods and services</li> 
                    <li>The transaction is documented according to policy</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Feeder transactions are not routed for online approval, nor does the originator make the above attestation in the financial system. The ability to act as a feeder into the financial system is granted by the Controller's Office with the understanding that the transactions follow University policy. Feeder business process owners must sign an annual attestation that they understand and accept their responsibilities and have followed the policies, and must pass Cost Policy Training as described in <a href="/3-1-4">Guide Memos 3.1.4</a>:&nbsp;Cost Policy, and <a href="/3-2-1">3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Deadlines</strong><br> Allocation journals should be prepared and submitted before the end of the month following the month the expense was posted.<br> <em>Example: </em>A cost that appears on an expenditure allocation PTA's March expenditure or operating statement should be allocated to the PTAs that benefited from the service by the last working day in April. Allocations submitted after the deadlines must include a valid reason for the delay.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The federal government and some nongovernment sponsors require that the University charge salaries and wages to sponsored projects as they are earned. However, many faculty members who are on 9-, 10-, or 11-month appointments choose to have a reduced salary amount paid over all 12 months of the year. To correctly charge sponsored project PTAs or the related cost sharing PTAs in such situations, departments may use the Labor Distribution Schedule method or the Salary Distribution Offset method. The Labor Distribution Schedule method is preferred, as it requires fewer accounting transactions to accomplish the result. In the employee's Oracle Labor Distribution Schedule sponsored or cost sharing PTAs are charged the appropriate percentage of the faculty member's 9-month salary (subject to any regulatory caps) for the academic period. The remainder of the amount to be PAID over 12 months is charged to an operating budget or other unrestricted PTA. For templates to aid in the calculation, see <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/res_jobaid/faculty_laborDist.html">Faculty Labor Distribution Entry Templates</a>. &nbsp;When following the Salary Distribution Offset (using after-the-fact Labor Distribution Adjustments for salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005, or Salary Journals for salary expenses originally incurred before April 1, 2005) method the department must:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Charge the faculty member's entire salary to the operating budget PTA paying for the non-research portion of salary. (For more information on payroll processing see <a href="/2-2-3">Guide Memo 2.2.3</a>:&nbsp;University Payroll, and <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/payadmin/payadmin_faculty.html">Faculty Specific Payroll Administration</a>.&nbsp;</li> 
                    <li>Record a transfer to allocate the amount of earned salary to the sponsored project(s).<br> The salary actually paid will show as a charge on the expenditure detail report for the operating budget PTA. The salary earned will show as a charge on the sponsored project expenditure detail report and as a credit on the operating budget expenditure detail report.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>a. Approvals</strong><br> Online signature of the person responsible for the PTA to be debited is required. Signature for the PTA to be credited is not required.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Deadlines</strong><br> Salary Distribution Offset transfers should be prepared and submitted in the month the salary is earned.<br> <i>Example: </i>Salary earned during April should be recorded during April.<br> A Salary Distribution Offset transfer submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Getting Started</strong><br> Allocations and offsets, including feeders, are submitted using iJournals or Labor Distribution Adjustments in the University's online financial system. Guidance on using the University's online accounting system, including procedures for using Allocation and Salary Journals, Uploads, Templates, and Labor Distribution Adjustments, is available from the <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/moyrendclose/index.html">Month-End/Year-End Close</a> section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Nonsalary Charges</strong><br> Allocations from expenditure allocation PTAs, service centers or other PTAs may be made by the following methods:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Allocation Journals</strong> are used for submitting a new allocation, a transaction containing repetitive transfers where charges have been previously authorized. Journal transactions entered using this form are limited to non-salary/student-aid expenditure types.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Allocation Templates</strong> may be set up to save time in processing repetitive allocations each month.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Upload Allocation and Feeder Journals</strong> may be used to upload an allocation created in another system.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Salary Charges</strong><br> Allocations from expenditure allocation PTAs or offsets are made by using a Labor Distribution Adjustment or a Salary Journal. See <a href="/3-2-2">Guide Memo 3.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Cost Transfers, for further guidance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Identification Needed</strong><br> All users of the University's online financial system must have a SUNet ID and password. Approvers must also have received appropriate delegated authority through the Authority Manager system (tutorial available <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/itss/services/authority/tutorial/introduction.html" target="_blank">online</a>) and passed the online test in the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/training/research-administration">Understanding Cost Policy class</a> with 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="/3-2-1">Guide Memo 3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures.</p>

                    <p>The Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004. The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge (ISC) from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&amp;A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.</p>
                    <p>Gifts for building projects are exempt from the infrastructure charge. The infrastructure charge collected from funds owned by non formula schools will be credited75% to a central University PFOO (project/fund/object code/org code) (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from funds owned by formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.</p>

General funds, alone, cannot bear the full burden of the infrastructure and administrative costs required to support these activities. The purpose of this policy is to recover a portion of these costs.</p>

Awards paying less than 8% indirect costs are not charged ISC but instead are charged their applicable IDC rates.<br> <strong>(2)</strong> The infrastructure charge is assessed on non-government sponsored project awards and awards sponsored by foreign governments. U.S. Government awards (federal, state and local government agencies) are excluded from infrastructure.<br> <strong>(3) </strong>The infrastructure charge is automatically exempted, but not waived (an alternate PTA must be provided by the principal investigator/ department to pay the infrastructure charge) on all non-government and foreign government awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating it does not pay indirects and the sponsor/program is on OSR's (Office of Sponsored Research) pre-approved IDC waiver list. A request to exempt the award from the infrastructure charge is not required.</p> 
                   <p>For all other sponsors who will not pay indirect costs, a request to exempt the award from the infrastructure charge must be submitted and approved by the Provost and the CFO before an institutional official approves the proposal for submission to the funding agency.</p>

                   <p>Revenue recognition should be based on accrual accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Revenues should be recognized when earned, and expenses should be recognized when incurred. Revenue is considered earned when the University has substantially met its obligation to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenue. Revenue should be recorded when earned, regardless of the timing of cash receipts. In the event a project stipulates performance measures, revenue is considered earned when the performance measures have been completed. Deposits (whether refundable or non-refundable), early payments and progress payments should not be recognized as revenue until the revenue producing event has occurred.</p>

                    <p>Procedures to follow when a suspicion or discovery of financial irregularities arise. Some common types of financial irregularities are corruption (e.g., bribery, kickbacks, bid riggings, etc.), conflicts of interest (e.g., sale and purchase schemes, etc.) and asset misappropriation involving cash, inventory or other University assets. Examples of asset misappropriation can include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>theft of cash</li>
                     <li>the use of a University issued credit card or the expense reimbursement system to make personal purchases</li>
                     <li>the directing of University resources such as supplies, inventory or labor to outside organizations</li>
                     <li>the directing of University revenues (e.g., event ticket proceeds, research funding, etc.) to outside organizations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Departments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities. Departments should not initiate an investigation. Departments should not discuss, interview or confront individuals about the suspected financial irregularity. Departments should<strong> </strong>not initiate any disciplinary actions without specific direction from the Office of General Counsel, or the Office of the Chief Risk Officer.</p>

Depending on the circumstances, the Office of the General Counsel may decide to direct the investigation.

                   <p>Stanford University will, on occasion, create or acquire a legal entity in furtherance of the university’s mission. These legal entities can serve many purposes, including the conduct of operations critical to the university (such as support of business registrations in countries outside of the United States). They also carry certain responsibilities, including organizational governance, financial controls, risk management, and government filings.</p> 
                   <p>This memo addresses the limited circumstances when a legal entity may be created, acquired, disposed of, or terminated by Stanford. This policy does not apply to investment entities or those entities received via donor gift, which are subject to other relevant policies and guidelines of the Stanford Management Company and the Office of Development, as applicable.</p> 
                   <p>As used in this policy, the term “legal entity” includes an organization recognized as separate from its owners by the relevant taxing authority or is otherwise recognized as having legal standing under the applicable laws. Examples of a legal entity include a corporation (for-profit or not-for-profit), limited liability company, partnership, unincorporated association, or trust. A legal entity may be formed within or outside the United States.</p>

                   <p>A legal entity affiliated with Stanford may be created, acquired, disposed of, or terminated only with the approval of both the Office of the General Counsel and Financial Management Services, per the procedure below. The university's individual schools and other operating units cannot take independent action with respect to legal entities. Stanford employees contemplating the creation, acquisition, disposition or termination of an affiliated legal entity should contact the Office of the General Counsel, which will provide advice on the approach best suited to support the programmatic objective. Registration and maintenance of a legal entity over its lifetime can be both time consuming and costly. Other alternatives may be more expedient and compatible with the goals of shorter term academic activities, such as a contractual arrangement with a local institution or seeking an exemption from registration, if possible. &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>In the event the General Counsel and the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance determine that it is necessary to take one of the above actions with respect to a legal entity, the General Counsel’s Office will provide guidance on the process. The department or school sponsoring the legal entity will be responsible for covering any costs arising from outside counsel and other agents that must be retained by the university to accomplish the requested action. In the event an entity is created or acquired, additional procedures will need to be established and followed by the sponsor to ensure the ongoing governance and maintenance of the entity.</p>

                   <h3>A.&nbsp; <strong>Statement of Financial Position</strong></h3> 
                   <p>The Statement of Financial Position is a financial statement that reports the balances of the University’s assets, liabilities and net assets at a point in time. The Statement of Financial Position is also known as a Balance Sheet. Additional information about the Statement for Financial Position is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.</p> 
                   <h3>B. <strong>Account Balance</strong></h3> 
                   <p>An account balance on the Statement of Financial Position represents the balance of an asset or liability at a point in time, such as at the end of a month, quarter or year.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The University’s assets on the Statement of Financial Position represent resources owned or used by the University and include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory, pledges receivable, loans receivable, investments, and plant facilities. Assets are designated with a 1XXXX series <a href="https://stanford.app.box.com/v/fingate-obi-object-code-active">object code</a> or <a href="https://stanford.app.box.com/v/fingate-obi-exp-type-active">expenditure type</a> in the University’s <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/res_jobaid.html">Chart of Accounts</a>. Assets typically have a debit (positive) balance.</li> 
                    <li>The University’s liabilities on the <a href="#_A.__Statement">Statement of Financial Position</a> represent debt or obligations to others and include accounts payable, accrued expenses, liabilities associated with investments, notes and bonds payable, and U.S. government refundable loan funds. Liabilities are designated with a 2XXXX series <a href="https://stanford.app.box.com/v/fingate-obi-object-code-active">object code</a> or <a href="https://stanford.app.box.com/v/fingate-obi-exp-type-active">expenditure type</a> in the University’s <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/res_jobaid.html">Chart of Accounts</a>. Liabilities typically have a credit (negative) balance.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h3>C. <strong>Account Balance Reconciliation</strong></h3> 
                   <p>An account balance reconciliation is the comparison of one or more asset or liability account balances in the general ledger to another, often independent or more detailed source of financial data, such as a bank statement, a subledger or another system. The differences between the account balance and the other source of financial data are reconciling items. Reconciling items may be caused by timing differences or errors, such as general ledger errors, bank errors, or subledger system errors that should be resolved in a timely manner.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <h3>A. Reconciliation Preparation and Review</h3> 
                   <p>At least quarterly, each University department with an asset or liability account balance in the general ledger is responsible for designating individuals who are responsible for reconciling and reviewing those balances on all ledgers (typically within 30 days of general ledger close).</p> 
                   <p>Multiple account balances that are of a similar nature may be reconciled together in one reconciliation, as needed. For some object codes there may be multiple account balances that are the responsibility of different departments. Each department is individually responsible for reconciling its respective balance.</p> 
                   <p>In addition to quarterly reconciliations, some account balances must be reconciled and reviewed monthly. The University Controller’s Office designates reconciliation frequency for account balances based on multiple factors including risk, materiality and history.</p> 
                   <p>Individuals responsible for reconciling and reviewing cash accounts should also refer to <a href="/chapter-3/subchapter-6/policy-3-6-1">Guide Memo 3.6.1:&nbsp;Bank Accounts</a> and the <a href="http://treasurer.stanford.edu/">Office of the Treasurer’s website</a> for additional guidance on bank reconciliations.</p> 
                   <p>Each University department with an account balance on the Statement of Financial Position is responsible for:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>developing and maintaining desk procedures for account balance reconciliations.</li> 
                    <li>ensuring that account balance reconciliations contain adequate supporting documentation.</li> 
                    <li>ensuring that reconciling items are resolved in a timely manner. &nbsp;</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Account balance reconciliation best practices and other resources are available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.</p> 
                   <h3>B. Correction of Transactional Errors</h3> 
                   <p>If transactional errors are discovered during the account reconciliation, the department is responsible for their correction.</p> 
                   <p>Information about how to correct miscoded transactions is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.</p> 
                   <h3>C. Compliance with Policies and Procedures</h3> 
                   <p>University departments are responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate reconciliation procedures, including reconciliation approval and segregation of duties. Refer to section <a href="#_d._Reconciliation_Roles">d. Reconciliation Roles</a> below for additional information about reconciliation segregation of duties.</p> 
                   <p>University departments are responsible for adhering to department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures. It is recommended that University departments annually review all department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures for accuracy and validity.</p> 
                   <p>University departments are responsible for adhering to all University policies and procedures during the reconciliation process. This includes but is not limited to adherence to University policies and procedures regarding:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Stewardship of University resources (see section 6 Financial Responsibilities and Internal Controls in <a href="/chapter-1/subchapter-1/policy-1-1-1">Guide Memo 1.1.1.:&nbsp;University Code of Conduct</a>)</li> 
                    <li>Record retention of approved reconciliations for future review by the University’s external auditors, internal auditors or the University Controller’s Office (see <a href="/chapter-3/subchapter-1/policy-3-1-5">Guide Memo 3.1.5:&nbsp;Retention of Financial Records</a>)</li> 
                    <li>Obtaining required transaction approvals (see the Financial Authority section of the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/finauthority/index.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website)</li> 
                    <li>Processing and approving Accounts Payable transactions in Oracle (see <a href="/chapter-5/subchapter-3">Guide Memo 5.3 Purchasing and Payments</a>)</li> 
                    <li>Processing and approving iJournals (see the Funds Management / About iJournals section of the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/iJournals/index.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website)</li> 
                    <li>Reporting alleged financial irregularities (see <a href="/chapter-3/subchapter-5/policy-3-5-1">Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities</a>)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <h3>D. Reconciliation Roles</h3> 
                   <p>University departments are responsible for establishing appropriate segregation of duties for account balance reconciliations. Segregation of duties is an internal control that helps safeguard University resources by separating responsibility for a task. The same individual should not prepare and also review a reconciliation. Additionally, University departments are responsible for segregating the reconciliation preparation and activity recording duties. The same individual should not record transactional activity and also reconcile the account balance.</p> 
                   <p>Reconciliation preparation and approval should only be performed by individuals with knowledge of the account balance and an understanding of the reconciliation purpose. Reconciliation reviewers are responsible for ensuring that reconciliation preparers are adequately trained and possess the skill, experience and competence for preparing the reconciliation.</p> 
                   <p>Reconciliation responsibilities are designated by role in the Reconciliation Roles and Responsibilities Matrix in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>A gift is any item of value given to the University by a donor who expects nothing of value in return, other than recognition (for example, being listed on an honor roll or naming a building, fund, professorship, etc. in the donor's honor).</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. "Quid Pro Quo" Situations</strong><br> If the University has given something of value in return for a gift, the donor's tax deduction is reduced by the fair market value of the benefit received. All "quid pro quo" gifts or gift solicitations must be reported to and cleared with the Office of Development. Contact Gift Processing, (650) 725-4360, or the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, in the Office of Development for further information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Non-Gifts</strong><br> <strong>(1) Sponsored Projects</strong><br> Consult the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/definitions-and-types-agreements/gift-vs-sponsored-projects-and-distinctions-other-forms-funding">Research Policy Handbook&nbsp;13.1</a> for the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Income</strong><br> Payment received for goods or services must be handled as income. See <a href="/1-5-3">Guide Memo 1.5.3</a>:&nbsp;Unrelated Business Activities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Non-Gift Financial Aid for a Named Student</strong><br> Support received from an outside individual or institution for the purpose of paying the tuition or other educational expenses of a specifically named student, where the University has no discretion in the assignment of the funds for any other student(s), is actually a gift to the specifically-named individual rather than to the University, and is accounted for by Stanford as Student Financial Aid. Such checks are to be sent, along with all accompanying documentation, to the Financial Aid Office, which will appropriately account for the payment.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Designation of Gifts to Stanford</strong><br> All gifts, regardless of value, form, or designated use, should be made payable to, or title should be transferred in the name of, Stanford University or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University. However, donors of securities can facilitate Stanford's gift processing effort by not re-registering the securities before giving them to the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Recording of Gifts</strong><br> All gifts of cash, securities, real estate, and capital equipment are recorded at market value as of the date of the gift by the Gift Processing section of the Office of Development and/or the Controller's Office. (See <a href="/4-2-2">Guide Memos 4.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Acknowledgement of Gifts and <a href="/4-2-3">4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment.) Gifts of tangible personal property (other than capital equipment covered under <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>) may be recorded&nbsp;if Development Services receives adequate documentation, including sufficient information for valuation.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Information About Gifts</strong><br> Questions about methods of giving, assignment, acknowledgment, recording, restrictions on, or purpose of a gift should be directed to the Office of Development. Questions about legal documentation, tax benefits, or requirements for gifts should be directed to the Office of Planned Giving, Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, (650) 725-4358.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Board of Trustees</strong><br> The Board of Trustees is the legal entity to which all gifts to the University are made and has responsibility for ensuring that gifts are properly accepted (or refused), processed, acknowledged, and used according to their terms and restrictions and in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. University President and Provost</strong><br> The President and Provost have ultimate administrative responsibility for determining the use of both unrestricted and restricted gifts, setting priorities for gift fundraising, and reviewing and setting policies concerning gifts, in consultation with the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Certain groups affiliated with Stanford that raise funds for University purposes may derive tax-deductible status for donors' contributions if gifts are made to and processed through the University. Such groups are encouraged to contact and consult with the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, prior to conducting any fundraising effort or event to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws as well as with University policy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Stanford Associates</strong><br> This group of Stanford alumni and friends was formed in 1935 to encourage financial support of the University and recognize those donors who make important contributions, either in terms of money or time. For information please contact Stanford Associates at 326 Galvez, (650) 725-4340.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Student Organizations</strong><br> Student organizations must apply to the ASSU Office of Student Activities at Stanford University as well as the Office of Development prior to soliciting potential donors, and work in conjunction with the Office of Development to plan and implement their fundraising efforts. Student organizations registered with the Office of Student Activities that receive gifts should contact the ASSU administrator to arrange for processing of those gifts through the University's gift processing system.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="gift-procurement-policies"><span class="prefix-container">5. </span>Gift Procurement Policies</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Gift Classification</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Cash and Checks</strong> (preferably made payable to Stanford University).</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Noncash Gifts</strong><br> Besides cash and checks, Stanford receives noncash gifts described below. Donors should be aware that tax laws distinguish between certain types of gifts for purposes of determining their charitable contribution deduction (see Section 5).</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Marketable Property</strong> — Gifts that are readily sold such as securities (e.g., stocks and bonds), real estate, and salable personal property.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Gifts in Kind</strong> — Gifts to be used in the form in which they are given, such as art objects, books, equipment, etc.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Rights and Insurance</strong> — Gifts which assign to the University the right to receive payments such as royalties or licensing fees, or that vest ownership in copyrights or trademark rights, and insurance policies that name the University as a beneficiary.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Donor Designation of Gift Use</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Expendable and Endowment Gifts</strong><br> A gift may be designated by the donor as expendable (i.e., immediately usable for current purposes), or as endowment (i.e., to be invested and held in perpetuity, with only the Board determined payout available&nbsp;to support University purposes). While donor intent is usually clear, certain types of gifts, such as bequests, may need additional research. Gifts will be recorded as expendable unless there is specific indication otherwise. Expendable gifts are invested in the Expendable Funds Pool; see <a href="/3-3-2">Guide Memo 3.3.2</a>:&nbsp;Expendable Funds Investment and Payout, for more information. Endowment gifts are invested in one of the University's merged pools depending on the donor's terms; contact Fund Accounting at (650) 723-9773 for more information. For further advice concerning donor designation of expendable and endowment gifts, contact the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development, (650) 725-4358.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Purpose</strong><br> Absent stipulations of purpose from the donor, gifts will be recorded as unrestricted expendable funds to support University purposes. If the donor designates a specific purpose for use of the gift (e.g., scholarships, student housing, a particular department, etc.) then the gift is considered to be restricted and the University is responsible for assuring that restrictions on use are honored unless (i) the donor specifically waives the restriction or (ii) court approval to change or void the restriction is granted. Approval to seek changes in the purpose of a gift fund by the above means can only be granted by the Provost; contact the Office of Planned Giving for instructions,&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">(650) 725-4358.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Establishing a Fund</strong><br> The department is responsible for instructing Gift Processing whether an existing fund should be credited with a gift (in which case, the fund number must be supplied), or whether a new fund should be established. <em>Gifts with different restrictions may not be commingled in a common fund.</em> If the donor designates a specific purpose and/or named fund, and no appropriate fund already exists, the department should forward the gift and all relevant original documentation to Gift Processing. Gift Processing will then coordinate with the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office, which establishes funds and records restrictions. Contact Fund Accounting for questions relating to a particular fund, (650) 723-9773.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="tax-considerations"><span class="prefix-container">6. </span>Tax Considerations</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The Internal Revenue Service has several requirements that relate to donor tax deductions for cash and noncash gifts to charities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Receipts</strong><br> It is Stanford's policy to issue receipts for all gifts (see <a href="/4-2-2">Guide Memo 4.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Acknowledgement of Gifts). The IRS requires a receipt to substantiate most charitable contribution deductions. The donor should retain the receipt in his/her records; it need not be filed with the tax return.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Deductibility</strong><br> Gifts to Stanford University are usually deductible at their full fair market value as of the date of the gift for both state and federal tax purposes. One important exception to this rule is that for gifts of tangible personal property that are intended to be resold by the University, the donor is entitled to an income tax deduction that is the lesser of the item's fair market value or the donor's cost basis. Contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358 for more information. Tax laws governing charitable gifts are complex; the University encourages donors to seek professional advice on tax issues.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Noncash Charitable Contributions (IRS Form 8283)</strong><br> <strong>(1) Noncash Gifts Over $500</strong><br> If a donors wishes to claim an income tax deduction of $500 or more in any year for gifts to charity which are not cash, then the donor must file IRS Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) with his or her federal income tax return. Form 8283 is available from the Office of Planned Giving.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Noncash Gifts Over $5,000</strong><br> In addition, if a donor wishes to claim charitable income tax deductions totaling $5,000 or more in any tax year for gifts that are not cash or publicly traded securities, then the donor needs to obtain qualified appraisals of the property donated and Stanford must acknowledge receipt by signing the IRS Form 8283, which the donor then files with his/her federal income taxes along with the qualified appraisal in certain cases. Donor should consult with his/her tax advisors on the filing requirements. Normally Stanford cannot provide or pay for an appraisal for a donor's tax purposes, nor will the University attempt to estimate the fair market value of any real or personal property gift.</p> 
                   <p>Form 8283 is processed either through the Property Management Office (PMO) (for gifts of capital equipment) or the Office of Development (for all other noncash gifts) and signed by the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office. The individual accepting the gift should make sure that the donor's name and Social Security number are on the Form 8283, and that the Accounting Officer is provided with the donor's address. It is the donor's responsibility to notify the University that they will require Stanford's acknowledgment on Form 8283.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Gifts of Securities</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Securities Not Publicly Traded</strong><br> A qualified appraisal and Stanford's acknowledgment of receipt on IRS Form 8283 are required for gifts of securities that are not publicly traded if their total value is more than $10,000.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Publicly Traded Securities</strong><br> Additional documentation is not required for gifts of publicly traded securities (regardless of their value).</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Donee Information Return (IRS Form 8282)</strong><br> Under certain circumstances described below, if Stanford sells, transfers, exchanges or otherwise disposes of donated property within two years of the date of receipt of the property, Stanford must file Form 8282 (Donee Information Return) with the IRS reporting such action. A department that becomes aware of such a disposition should immediately notify the Property Management Office (for capital equipment) or the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office (for all other property). Among the information required is the name of the donor, their address and tax ID or Social Security number, and any amount received upon disposition. If the transfer is made to a successor donee (that is, another nonprofit entity), information concerning that donee must be included as well. Form 8282 must be filed with the IRS within 125 days of the date of disposition (except as noted in 5.d.(3) below), with a copy to the donor. The Accounting Officer is responsible for preparation of the Form 8282 and its transmittal to the IRS and to the donor. <em>This filing requirement applies only to the following items of donated property or equipment:</em></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1)</strong> Property for which Stanford has completed the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 (see above section 5.c.(2)).</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) </strong>Property that is considered a <strong>restricted </strong>donation under Section 170 (e)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. This consists of donated equipment where Stanford has committed 80 percent of its use for research, experimentation, or research training conducted in the United States, in the physical or biological sciences.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3)</strong> Property for which Stanford has <strong>not completed</strong> the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 but which the University later becomes aware should have been so substantiated, e.g. where such property had a fair market value of more than $5,000 as of the date of donation and the donor failed to submit Form 8283 to Stanford for acknowledgment. In this case Form 8282 must be filed within 60 days from the date that the University becomes aware of the omission.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Prompt Delivery of Gifts</strong><br> All gifts arriving at or transferred to any part of the university should be initiated in the Gift Transmittal system by a trained user, and then be sent on the same day the gift is received to the Development Services department in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018. Alternately, gifts may be sent to the local development offices in the schools and departments across campus. Gifts to the School of Medicine should always be sent directly to Medical Center Development. Gifts should <em><strong>never </strong></em>be sent to the Controller's Office, Fund Accounting, or the Cashier's Office.</p> 
                   <p>For gifts of equipment, see <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Required Documentation</strong><br> In all cases, the university unit that has received the gift must follow these steps:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Scan all original correspondence pertaining to a gift, including the envelope and/or shipping label. The postmarked envelope will ensure the proper gift date is verified and recorded by Development Services.</li> 
                    <li>Initiate a Gift Transmittal. An authorized Gift User may go to <a href="https://ofweb.stanford.edu" target="_blank">the system</a> and login using SUNet ID and password. Instructions are available on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/gift/howto/initiate_gift.html#top" target="_blank">Fingate&nbsp;</a>website.</li> 
                    <li>Complete the Gift Transmittal form as appropriate. Instructions for authorized users are on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/gift/howto/complete_transmittal.html" target="_blank">Fingate</a>&nbsp;website.<br> The office forwarding the gift can save the scanned documents for their records through the fiscal year, but please note that this is optional and that once posted to PostGrads, documents should be deleted from local files.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions should be directed to Development Services, (650) 725-4360 or <a href="mailto:development-services@lists.stanford.edu">development-services@lists.stanford.edu</a>.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Donor Record Files</strong><br> The Office of Development maintains complete donor records, including all university alumni and friends, as well as corporations and foundations that support the university. Original donor correspondence and copies of all university correspondence pertaining to gifts should be sent to the Office of Development, Development Services. The Office of Development will forward gift documents to the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office as appropriate.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="types-of-gifts"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Types of Gifts</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Cash</strong><br> Do not send cash through interdepartmental or other mail service. Call Development Services (650) 725-4360 for instructions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Checks</strong><br> Checks should be forwarded to Development Services (326 Galvez Street, mail code: 5018) immediately for prompt deposit after initiating the Gift Transmittal (see above). Holding checks results in lost interest earnings for the university and, if not cashed in a reasonable amount of time, may eventually result in invalidation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Securities</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Stock certificates received by a school or department should be forwarded to the Gift Securities team immediately for prompt processing. If stock certificates are received in the mail the postmarked envelope must be included so that the Gift Securities team can determine the correct date for valuing the shares and dating the gift receipt. If stock certificates are received via private courier (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, DHL), the department must include a memo stating when the envelope was received in the department. The university will, in almost all cases, sell the securities through its brokers after they are received. </span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(1) Delivery of Securities</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The transfer of securities to Stanford may be accomplished in several ways: </span></p> 
                   <p><strong>(i) Broker-to-Broker Transfer:&nbsp;</strong>Donors should instruct their broker to transfer securities intended for Stanford to the university by contacting the Gift Securities team in the Controller’s Office (ph # 650-721-1917, fax # 650-721-2417, email: <a href="mailto:stockgifts@stanford.edu" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">stockgifts@stanford.edu</a>), who will provide instructions for the donor’s broker to initiate the gift transfer. A copy of any gift transmittal letter or other related correspondence should be sent immediately to the Gift Securities team.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(ii) Mail:&nbsp;</strong>Endorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University) as transferee may be sent by regular mail (certified mail recommended) to:</p> 
                   <p>By USPS:<br> Stanford University-Gift Securities<br> P.O. Box 50810<br> Palo Alto, CA 94303</p> 
                   <p>By Courier (FedEx, UPS, or other overnight delivery):<br> Stanford University-Gift Securities<br> 3145 Porter Drive<br> Palo Alto, CA 94304</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(iii) Hand Delivery:</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;Endorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board...) as transferee may be delivered by hand to any of the following locations:</span></p> 
                   <p>Office of Development<br> Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center<br> 326 Galvez Street<br> Stanford University<br> Stanford, California 94305-6105</p> 
                   <p>Stanford Management Company<br> Gifts and Distributions Administrator<br> 635 Knight Way<br> Stanford, California 94305-7297</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Certificate in Excess of Gift</strong><br> If a donor's stock certificate is for a greater number of shares than he or she plans to give the university, the certificate may be endorsed to Stanford with instructions to keep a specified number of shares as a gift and to have a new certificate for the balance issued to the donor. The donor or the university office forwarding the certificate should include clear written instructions in this regard.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Credit Cards</strong><br> Donors may charge gifts to their Mastercard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express credit cards by indicating in writing the amount of the gift, their credit card number, the date of its expiration, and their signature (as the name appears on the credit card). This written information should be forwarded to Development Services, 326 Galvez Street, 94305-6105, or secure fax (650) 723-0020. Donors may also call Development Services at (650) 725-4360 to make a credit card gift. If a Stanford employee receives credit card information intended for a gift, they should send it to Development Services via the Office of Development courier service, fax it via the secure fax number, put the information in the one of the two gift drop boxes on campus (located at the Alumni Center and the Edwards building) or hand-carry it to the Development Services office. <strong>DO NOT</strong> email credit card information or send it via campus mail as both of these options have serious potential for security risks.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Electronic Transfers</strong><br> Donors may make gifts to the university through three types of electronic transfer.<br> <strong>(1) Wire Transfer</strong><br> A donor who wishes to make a gift via wire transfer into a Stanford account must contact Development Services to obtain current instructions and to make sure the appropriate university personnel are alerted to the transaction.<br> <strong>(2) Payroll Deduction</strong><br> Stanford employees may authorize a set amount to be deducted from their paychecks as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for payroll deduction gifts Stanford employees should contact Development Services, which will make arrangements with the Payroll Department. Employees wishing to change, renew, or cancel payroll deduction gifts should send a written request to Development Services.<br> <strong>(3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Direct Deposit</strong><br> Donors may authorize a set amount to be automatically withdrawn from their checking or savings accounts as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for EFT gifts donors should contact Development Services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Memorial and </strong><strong>Honorarium Gifts</strong><br> In most cases, the university uses memorial gifts (i.e., contributions made in memory of someone who has passed away) to support the objects and purposes of the university; honorarium gifts made in honor of a special event or living person are handled in the same way. If an alternative purpose is preferred, a separate memorial or named fund may be established through the Office of Development.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Gifts of Real or Personal Property</strong><br> If a gift of real estate or an item of personal property is offered to Stanford it is important that the proper university department or official determine whether the university is able to accept it. Such decisions are made according to established university policies and guidelines according to the type of gift.<br> <strong>(1) Real Estate Gifts</strong><br> The Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, and the Director of Gift Real Estate in the Real Estate department within Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate should be notified of a donor's intent to make a gift of real property to the university. The Director of Gift Real Estate must first inspect the property and determine that the property may be accepted by the university. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving will then obtain any necessary Board of Trustees approval, draft requisite documents, make arrangements for title to be transferred to the university and for the gift to be credited in Development Services, and work with the donor regarding the Internal Revenue Service Form 8283. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving is available to respond to donors’ tax and other related questions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Gifts in Kind (Tangible Personal Property)<br> (i) Categories</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Equipment</strong>: See <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Artifacts, specimens, and historical objects for departmental special collections</strong>: see <a href="/4-2-4">Guide Memo 4.2.4</a>:&nbsp;Departmental Special Collections.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Gifts of Personal Property for Resale</strong>: Gifts of personal property intended for resale should not be accepted unless it is determined that the item is appropriate for the University to resell. Examples include gifts made for the Committee for Art's Treasure Market or for a rummage sale to benefit a particular department or project. Questions about the salability of items not earmarked for a specific sales event may be directed to the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/property-management-office">Property Management Office</a>.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(ii) Prior Consultation</strong><br> The Office of Planned Giving should be contacted prior to accepting gifts in kind to make sure that the donor has been apprised of tax deductibility and IRS substantiation requirements, and to assist in drafting any agreements with the donor relating to the gift. Development Services must then be notified in order for the donor to obtain a gift receipt unless previously arranged procedures have been established for the unit (e.g., University Libraries, Treasure Market) to issue its own receipt.<br> <strong>(iii) Delivery Arrangements</strong><br> Gifts in kind that Stanford plans to keep and use are usually delivered directly to the relevant school, department, laboratory, library, or museum that has previously approved the item's acceptance and is where the item will be housed. Preliminary arrangements may also include agreements regarding costs of packing and freight charges, which are usually the responsibility of the donor.<br> <strong>(iv) Recording</strong><br> Except for donated capital equipment, gifts in kind are not normally recorded in the donor's gift record nor in the University's accounting system; contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information about exceptions for crediting gifts in kind to a donor's record.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Special Types of Gifts<br> (1) Life Income Gifts</strong><br> Donors may arrange to make a gift to Stanford that will pay them and/or a designated beneficiary an income for life or for a term of years. After the death of the last beneficiary or expiration of the term of years, the gift remainder is used by the university as specified by the donor. Contact the Office of Planned Giving for further information and/or to arrange for a consultation with a donor and their advisor(s).<br> <strong>(2) Bargain Sales</strong><br> Under some circumstances, the university may provide some cash consideration below market value to a donor in exchange for a gift of real or personal property. Offers to sell art objects, equipment, securities, real estate, etc. to Stanford at a substantially discounted price should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving. The amount of the gift recorded by Development Services will be the difference between the fair market value and the discounted price.<br> <strong>(3) Life Insurance</strong><br> Donors may make life insurance gifts in a number of ways:<br> <strong>(i) </strong>by naming the university as the beneficiary of the policy;<br> <strong>(ii)</strong> by transferring ownership of a paid-up policy to the university; or<br> <strong>(iii)</strong> by transferring ownership of a policy to the university and making periodic gifts to the university to cover payment of the policy premiums. Stanford does not make premium payments from sources other than gifts intended for such purposes. The tax ramifications of life insurance gifts are complicated; questions should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving.<br> <strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;<strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Bequests&nbsp;</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Since its founding, Stanford has derived significant and ongoing support from bequest gifts. Names of donors who have confirmed that a bequest for Stanford is included in their will or trust should be forwarded to the Office of Planned Giving along with any known details of the gift.&nbsp; The Office of Planned Giving operates The Founding Grant Society, which recognizes and honors those who have made life income gifts or who have indicated that a bequest to the University is included in their estate plans. Staff counsel in the </span>Office of<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> Planned Giving </span>are<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> available to consult with donors and their advisors in the drafting of bequests to the University. Information about or questions concerning any bequest gift that has matured should be immediately referred to the Manager of Trusts and Bequests in the Office of Planned Giving (650/725‑4358).</span><br> <b style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(5) Matching Programs</b><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">This section does not pertain to Corporate </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Matching Gifts</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">, which are addressed below in subsection (6).</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">An important consideration with matching programs is our ability to steward gifts that provide and receive matching by ensuring that the process works correctly and in a timely manner. The administrative effort involved is significant, and we want to be certain that existing and new programs are structured in a way that can be implemented effectively. Consult with the Office of Development Finance Department if you are considering a new matching program or think a fund should qualify for some sort of match. The Finance team needs to understand the desired ratios and timing and can help to structure the program.</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Matching funds should be separated and only used for matching purposes. Please be aware that with existing matching automation, when the matching source is an endowment fund, transfers can only take place from endowment principal.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All new matching programs must be approved by the Vice President for Development, so please be sure you have approval before committing to a matching program with a donor.</span></strong><br> <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(6) Corporate Matching Gifts</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Donors or their spouses may work for, serve on the board of, or be retired from, a company that will match their gifts to Stanford. Donors should follow their company's procedures, which usually involve filling out a form and sending it to Stanford with their gift. Departments or other units that receive any corporate matching forms MUST forward the forms to Development Services in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, and should </span><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">NOT </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">sign the forms themselves or return them to the company. Only Development Services is authorized to verify to a company that a gift qualifies for matching funds.</span></p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Tax-Year End</strong><br> During the month of December the volume of gifts to be processed increases sharply. Departments or other units receiving gifts during this very busy time of year should expedite delivery of gifts to Development Services and should take steps (described below) to verify the date of the gift so that the receipt issued by Development Services to the donor will reflect the proper date for the donor's tax purposes. The gift receipt will bear a December date even when the gift is processed in January if the gift is received in Development Services on or before December 31 or if the date is verified in one of the following ways:<br> <strong>(1) Hand Delivery</strong><br> Gifts may be delivered to any Stanford representative on or before December 31 in order to be treated as a gift made during that tax year. The Stanford representative should provide the donor with a signed and dated memo acknowledging receipt for securities or cash, keeping a copy to send to Development Services, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, with the gift. In addition, the Stanford representative should sign or initial a notation of the date the gift was delivered directly on the check, or on the remit or any correspondence accompanying the gift.<br> <strong>(2) Postmarks</strong><br> The date of receipt for gifts received by mail is the postmark date that appears on the envelope. Therefore during December and early January it is especially important to include the postmarked envelope along with the gift when forwarding it to Development Services.<br> <strong>(3) Transfers</strong><br> Broker to broker transfers of securities and wire transfers of cash must be completed and the transferred property must be in Stanford's account by December 31 to count as a gift for that tax year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Fiscal Year-End</strong><br> The university fiscal year ends August 31. To be reflected in the university's record for a given fiscal year, gifts must be received in Development Services by 2:00 p.m. on the last working day of the fiscal year. Gifts processed later, even if dated before August 31, will be entered in the University's records in the following fiscal year. After the end of the fiscal year, requests for corrections to gift records should be made to Development Services at <a href="mailto:development-services@lists.stanford.edu">development-services@lists.stanford.edu</a>, who will in turn coordinate the necessary journal entries with Fund Accounting.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>All gifts to Stanford of cash, checks, and securities, as well as most other types of gifts, are officially acknowledged by the University through the Office of Development.</strong> It is the Office of Development's goal to issue a receipt to the donor within 10 working days after Development Services has been notified and received relevant documentation for each gift. Receipts issued by Development Services conform to certain government mandated format requirements, including a statement as to whether the donor has received anything of value in return for the gift and, where applicable, a reference to the University's charge on restricted funds (see <a href="/3-3-1">Guide Memo 3.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Infrastructure Charges). Under Federal law donors must possess a conforming gift receipt in order to claim a tax deduction for most charitable contributions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Monetary Gifts</strong><br> Receipts state the dollar value of the gift.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Securities Gifts</strong><br> Receipts describe the number and type of securities donated, and as a courtesy to the donor will generally state the value of any publicly-traded securities credited to the donor's gift record. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Other Nonmonetary Gifts</strong><br> Receipts describe the gift in reasonably specific terms, including number and type of property involved, but do not include a valuation. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility. For equipment gifts, see <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment. Receipts for gifts of real estate are issued by the Office of Development in coordination with the Gift Real Estate section of the Stanford Management Company.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. "Quid Pro Quo" Gifts</strong><br> Under federal law, receipts for gifts made to Stanford where the University has given the donor something of value in return must state this fact on the University's gift receipt and must include a valuation of the benefit received by the donor. The donor's tax deduction is reduced by this amount. These requirements do not apply to certain narrowly defined nominal items given in return for a gift (contact Development Services, (650) 725-4360, or Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information).</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Life Income Gifts</strong><br> Planned Giving in the Office of Development is responsible for preparing and issuing receipts for life income gifts.</p>

                   <p>In addition to the University's official gift receipt, certain gifts are acknowledged by a letter signed by the President of the University and/or the Vice President for Development, a School Dean, a Director of a Center, or the Chair of the Board of Trustees. Stewardship Officers throughout the University have the responsibility for tracking gifts that meet certain criteria (which vary slightly from area to area and by signer) and drafting letters for the appropriate signature.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Gifts for University Purposes</strong><br> A donation of capital equipment such as a computer, laboratory equipment, vehicle, or machine tool that is to be used for University purposes must be recorded as a donation in the University accounting system at the Controller's Office and in the University's Sunflower Assets system (SFA) and in Oracle Fixed Assets. The items are recorded at fair market value as of the date of donation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Gifts for Resale</strong><br> A donation of equipment that is given with the understanding that the University intends to resell it <strong>upon receipt</strong> should not be entered into the University's accounting system or in Sunflower Assets. However any sale proceeds should be recorded as a gift of cash in the Controller's Office and reported to the Office of Development for inclusion in its gift records. If sale action is not initiated within 60 days of receipt, the donated item must be recorded in the Sunflower Assets system and in Oracle Fixed Assets.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Capital Equipment</strong> is equipment that individually at the time of donation has (i) a minimum market value of $5,000 or more and (ii) a useful life of more than one year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Fair Market Value</strong> for various circumstances:</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Educational Discount</strong><br> If an educational discount is normally available to Stanford for purchase of the equipment, its recorded value should be net of the applicable educational discount; i.e., the fair market value is the price at which the vendor (donor) will sell the equipment to Stanford.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) New Equipment From Private Individuals</strong><br> Equipment purchased for the purpose of a donation is valued at the invoice price to the donor. Donation must occur within 60 days of purchase.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Used Equipment</strong><br> Fair market value is obtained from backup paperwork or appraisal (at the donor's expense) verifying the value at the time of the donation. At the discretion of the University Property Management Office (PMO) and at the cost of the receiving fund (school/department), an independent or a second appraisal may be requested.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Additional Costs</strong><br> Any third party installation or modification costs, attachments, accessories or auxiliary apparatus that are <strong>paid for by the department</strong> to make the donation usable for the purpose that it was given are <strong><em>not </em></strong>included in the equipment valuation. However, they <strong><em>are </em></strong>included in the acquisition cost when the item is entered into Sunflower Assets and Oracle Fixed Assets.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Cost-Benefit Considerations</strong><br> When deciding whether to acquire or deaccession<sup>1</sup> collections, departments should consider the short- and long-term benefits of the items for research, teaching, and historical significance in relation to the short- and long-term costs of maintaining the collection. Obligations to the donor must be considered and any written restrictions placed on the donated collection by the donor must also be honored in deaccession decisions.</p> 
                   <p>Costs for personnel; space, security, and environmental needs; preservation; insurance; and use of the collection (for display, loan, research, or teaching aids) should be estimated in relation to departmental priorities for teaching and research as well as the current and prospective availability of funding. These funding estimates should take into account:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Current available monies for personnel, and facilities that could be employed, without increased costs, for the management and protection of the collection</li> 
                    <li>Additional monies needed to cover current estimated costs</li> 
                    <li>Projected changes in costs for the future</li> 
                    <li>Sources of future internal funding</li> 
                    <li>Sources of external support (grants, gifts)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Administrative Structure</strong><br> To facilitate ongoing management, departments should:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Establish procedures for periodically reviewing benefits of the collection in relation to its cost</li> 
                    <li>Clarify lines of authority for making decisions to deaccession collections</li> 
                    <li>Establish policies on the reuse of funds gained from selling a collection</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <hr> 
                   <p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>"Deaccession" is a technical term used by librarians and museum curators. It means to remove an object permanently from a collection.<br> &nbsp;</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Responsibility</strong><br> When a school or department makes a decision to accept as a gift or loan or otherwise develop or acquire a collection of artifacts or other materials, it takes on the responsibility to fund, house, manage, preserve, and, if appropriate, dispose of these items. Before entering into a written agreement with a prospective donor that carries restrictions on the use, care, or disposition of a collection, the school or department may wish to consult with the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development and/or the Cantor Arts Center, Libraries and Archives.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Inventory and Control<br> (1) Record-keeping</strong><br> Departments should have an inventory system for current and new acquisitions of collections and on-going record-keeping practices for controlling their use and protection. See also <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment, for policies on recording gifts of capital equipment.<br> <strong>(2) Cataloging</strong><br> To facilitate the use of a departmental collection, departments may want to prepare a catalog, either manual (such as a card catalog) or computerized (such as a data base file).<br> <strong>(3) Security</strong><br> <a href="/2-4-5">Guide Memo 2.4.5</a>:&nbsp;Protection of Property, outlines departmental responsibilities for safeguarding precious and high value items.<br> <strong>(4) Control of Access/Facilitation of Use</strong><br> Departments should develop access and lending policies (where applicable), information about the availability and display of the collection, and a system for tracking the collection over time which will serve to increase and facilitate the use of the collection, and at the same time provide appropriate protection and security for the contents. Departments have the discretionary authority to restrict the use of a collection; any such restrictions should be noted in the publicity.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Care of Collections<br> (1) Preservation</strong><br> Collections should be stored, used, lent out, and displayed in a manner that will minimize the risk of loss, theft and damage (see <a href="/2-4-5">Guide Memo 2.4.5</a>:&nbsp;Protection of Property. All policies for preservation should be developed to maximize the enhancement of the collections for their present and future use. Policies developed for the preservation of collections in the Cantor Arts Center, the Libraries and Archives can be referred to as useful models in the development of departmental policies.<br> <strong>(2) Space Allocation and Use</strong><br> The space used to store and display collections should be environmentally appropriate and secure.<br> <strong>(3) Personnel</strong><br> Departmental collections must be supervised by an assigned individual. When the advice of curators is needed, departments should utilize the expertise of curators in Green Library, the Hoover Archives and the Cantor Arts Center.<br> <strong>(4) Budget</strong><br> Funding for personnel and other costs of the care, display, and use of the collections is a departmental responsibility.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Disposition of Deaccessioned Collections<br> (1) Considerations</strong><br> Deaccessioned collections must be disposed of in a manner that respects the intentions of the donor and does not diminish the assets of the institution. If there are written restrictions pertaining to the gift they must be honored unless waived by the donor.<br> <strong>(2) Consultation</strong><br> If necessary, departments should seek legal counsel, including staff counsel in the Office of Development, and independent expert opinion. If possible, they should also inform the donors and/or their heirs of the proposed action. If the collection was a gift, the Office of Development should be notified of the department's plans.<br> <strong>(3) Means of Disposal</strong><br> The department should develop policies on appropriate means of disposal, such as sale, transfer to another institution, or destruction. Policies developed for the deaccessioning of collections in the Cantor Arts Center, the Libraries and Archives can be referred to as useful models.<br> <strong>(4) Further Information</strong><br> Departments considering selling a collection should consult <a href="/5-2-4">Guide Memo 5.2.4</a>:&nbsp;Surplus Property Sales.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. New Facilities and Land Features</strong><br> Names proposed for Stanford University facilities and land features require the review of the Office of Development, Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/University Architect/Campus Planning and Design (UA/CPD), and the Office of Campus Engagement for possible conflicts and other University-wide implications before submission to the President for approval. Facilities and land features covered by this requirement include: buildings and the components of buildings (classrooms, laboratories, auditoria, conference and seminar rooms); ornamental structures; streets; fountains; courts; plazas; gardens; etc.&nbsp;This policy applies to facilities and features developed and used by Stanford including but not limited to the following locations:&nbsp;the Main Campus and Foothills, Stanford Redwood City Campus, university occupied facilities in the&nbsp;Stanford Research Park, and Hopkins Marine Station.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Renaming Facilities and Land Features</strong></p> 
                   <p>Proposals to remove names from university facilities or land features will follow the process laid out in the "<a href="https://campusnames.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/03/Stanford-Renaming-Principles-final.pdf" target="_blank">Principles and Procedures for Renaming Buildings and Other Features at Stanford University</a>" (hereafter referred to as the "Principles").</p> 
                   <p>As outlined in the Principles, the President may initiate the process of reconsidering the name of a building or feature, if necessary, in response to a request submitted by members of the university or at his or her own initiative. For consideration by the President, requests from the community shall contain certain elements described in the Principles.</p> 
                   <p>If the renaming process described in the Principles results in a decision to eliminate a name, the President will initiate a process to determine a new name for the feature. This will normally follow the procedure described below in 1.c.</p> 
                   <p>In cases of requests for renaming proposed by a university unit, the senior line officer(s) in whose jurisdiction the facility or land feature is located and the Provost must be notified before the request is submitted to the President.</p> 
                   <p><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">c. New or Additional Names</strong></p> 
                   <p>In cases of proposals for new names that do not require the removal of existing names, the senior line officer(s) in whose jurisdiction the facility or land feature is located should have the sponsorship of the Provost in submitting the recommended name for the approval procedure described in 1.a. Individuals considering proposing a new name must consult with the relevant senior line officer(s) to determine if the feature is available for naming. Requests from the community will normally be considered only with the approval of the relevant senior line officer(s). Note that proposals for new names should be guided by the policies described in Section 2.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">d. Plaques, Trees and Other Similar Memorials</strong></p> 
                   <p>While Stanford gratefully accepts gifts in memory of someone, the University is not normally able to accommodate requests for plaques, trees, benches, or other similar memorials. Donors who wish to make a gift and receive the appropriate recognition should consult with the Office of Development.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Stanford schools and units rely upon gifts from alumni, parents of students, friends, corporations, associations, and foundations to meet a substantial portion of its operating and capital costs. University donors are often acknowledged for their contribution with the honor of a named feature.&nbsp;Because of the importance of philanthropy in supporting the university’s research and teaching mission, named features are normally associated with a gift to the university.</p> 
                   <p>a. <strong>Names of Faculty and Staff</strong><br> In addition to the approval process for naming New Facilities and Land Features in&nbsp;4.2.5 Section 1.a., names of Stanford faculty and staff to be considered for Stanford University facilities and land features must be selected from individuals who are emeritus, retired or deceased. If the individual has left the university but is not a retiree or emeritus, special approval by the Provost would be required.&nbsp;Schools and departments wishing to honor faculty, staff, or students are encouraged to consider avenues other than naming spaces.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Streets</strong><br> Street names should be historically or geographically significant to the campus. Streets may be named for living individuals, but the use of individuals' names should be minimized.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Donor Names</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) Buildings</strong><br> Donor names proposed for buildings or portions of buildings are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The "name" gift will normally cover between 35 and 70 percent of total project costs.<br> <strong>(2) Other Features</strong><br> Donor names proposed for fountains, ornamental buildings, campus exterior spaces, and similar features will normally require a gift to cover the full cost of the project and a maintenance fund.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Groups</strong></p> 
                   <p>University features will normally not be named for groups of people (e.g., "All Californians"). Exceptions may include families or university classes (e.g., "Class of 1986").</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Events</strong></p> 
                   <p>University features will normally not be named for specific events (e.g., "Big Game 1974").</p>

This cooperative and collegial relationship has set Stanford apart from most of its peers.</p> 
                   <p>During the 1990s, we encouraged intensified fundraising programs within the schools/units, many of which conducted individual campaigns. These successful specific initiatives culminated in the Campaign for Undergraduate Education —the largest capital campaign ever launched specifically for undergraduate education. While these individual efforts have been quite successful in developing new and more engaged donors, it is imperative that we continue to nurture a broad understanding and commitment to Stanford University.</p> 
                   <p>Because the majority of the University's most generous donors have multiple interests, the advent of unit based campaigns also has created more intense pressure on the prospect population. We need to reinforce the spirit of cooperation that has characterized Stanford's development activities for more than 50 years. That cooperation is based upon open and regular communication between the schools/units and the University development office, and among the schools/units.</p> 
                   <p>The ultimate responsibility for securing new gifts for the University rests with the Board of Trustees. The trustees have delegated those responsibilities to the Office of the Development through the President of the University. The Vice President for Development is entrusted with the overall management of Stanford's fundraising programs. Obviously, while many of the fundraising activities may be delegated and carried out at the school/unit level, major development activities, decisions, and solicitations are ultimately managed and coordinated by the Office of the Vice President for Development.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Prospects with Multiple Affiliations</strong><br> All activities with any Stanford prospect with multiple affiliations must be coordinated with all the interested parties. This is especially true for all major rated prospects—$250,000 or more. All prospects rated at this level or higher will be given a primary staff assignment. Any and all solicitation activity on these prospects must be coordinated through the primary staff person.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Prospects Rated at $1,000,000 and Above</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All prospects with a rating of $1,000,000 and above are, by definition, University prospects.&nbsp;Unless a request to such prospects is for a previously approved annual solicitation, all solicitation activity–even if the solicitation is significantly less than $1,000,000–must be approved by the Office of the Vice President for Development through the Prospect Clearance System (PCS).</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Authority of the Vice President for Development</strong><br> If an agreement cannot be reached on assigning or approaching multiple-interest or "University" prospects, then the Vice President for Development will determine prospect assignment and access by taking into account priorities set by the President and Provost. The dean or director of a school or unit may appeal the Vice President's decision to the Provost.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Sharing and Storage of Information</strong><br> It is imperative that all pertinent information regarding major gift prospect activity be available across the development enterprise. This is particularly true for $1-million-plus rated prospects. University development staff and school/unit development officers share a responsibility to keep others informed of prospect activity, both formally (by updating the prospect tracking system and sending written communications to Post Grads) and informally (through regular communication). These updates should be entered in a timely fashion to ensure real-time quality to the prospect information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Volunteers</strong><br> Schools and units may form volunteer organizations to support major fundraising initiatives with the approval of the Vice President for Development. Chairs of volunteer groups supporting major fundraising programs will be asked to coordinate their activities through the Board of Trustees' Committee on Development and to work together with University-wide volunteer groups. Enlistment of volunteers, whether for fundraising or for advisory boards and councils, must be coordinated through the Office of the Vice President for Development.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Written Communications</strong><br> To assure consistency and coordination among various fundraising efforts, final drafts of written communications describing major fundraising initiatives must be shared with the Vice President for Development or designee. Additionally, the Office of Planned Giving must review all agreements of $100,000 or more (and all agreements establishing new endowments) prior to submission to the donor and/or acceptance by the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Staffing</strong><br> School and unit staff and budget plans for fundraising must be reviewed and approved by the Provost. Decisions regarding classification and compensation of development staff rest with the dean/director and the Vice President for Development who share responsibility for assuring that fairness is maintained across the University. In addition, the Vice President for Development must review and approve any requests to hire external fundraising consultants.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Priority Setting Process</strong><br> Development priorities will be established in accordance with <a href="/4-4-1">Guide Memo 4.4.1</a>:&nbsp;Fundraising Approval and Priority-Setting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Annual Giving</strong><br> The following policies govern annual giving at Stanford:<br> <strong>(1) Stanford Fund</strong><br> The Stanford Fund exists to provide the President and Provost with sustained, discretionary gift support for undergraduate education and undergraduate student life. All undergraduate degree holders, including those with a Stanford graduate degree, professional school degree, or credits earned toward such degrees, are solicited by the fund. The Stanford Fund also solicits non-degree holders with credits earned toward a Stanford undergraduate degree and parents of current undergraduates and non-alumni ("friends") with a prior history of giving to the fund.<br> <strong>(2) School Funds</strong><br> The school funds may solicit their graduate and professional degree holders, including those who also have an undergraduate degree from Stanford. The school funds are also able to solicit non-undergraduate degree holders with credits earned toward a Stanford graduate or professional degree. Departments and programs may not solicit their graduates. Other solicitable populations include non-alumni ("friends") with a prior history of giving to the school and parents of Stanford professional or graduate degree holders.<br> <strong>(3) Athletics</strong><br> The Department of Athletics may solicit any current or former annual donors to athletics, former student-athletes, and Stanford season ticket holders.<br> <strong>(4) Medical</strong><br> Subject to any applicable restrictions imposed by law, alumni who are treated as patients at Stanford Medical Center may be solicited by medical development.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Applicability</strong><br> The procedures detailed in this Guide Memo apply whenever approval is sought to raise gifts from individuals, foundations, associations or corporations to support a project. Projects are defined broadly to include any program or activity of the University and/or its schools and units. Gifts are defined in <a href="/4-1-1">Guide Memo 4.1.1</a>:&nbsp;Gifts to the University. These procedures do not apply to the following:</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Certain small projects</strong><br> Projects for which the total fundraising requirement over the life of the project is less than $1,000,000 require only decanal or directorial approval if all of the fundraising will be handled within the school or unit by the faculty and/or school's or unit's development staff without assistance sought from the central Office of Development. However, (1) clearance to approach each specific prospect is still required under <a href="/chapter-4/subchapter-3/policy-4-3-1">Guide Memo 4.3.1[2]</a>: Operating Policies for Development; and (2) the proposed gift should be reviewed with central development staff if there are any unusual terms or circumstances relating to a particular gift, such as if the prospect has no prior relationship with Stanford, if the gift is to fund a new program or project or if any of the gift terms are unusual.<br> <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">(2) Facilities</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Requests for approval to raise funds for facilities projects are handled as part of the Provost's Capital Plan process. Approval of a facilities project, including new construction and renovation projects, will include a careful consideration of potential funding sources. Facilities projects will be assigned a fundraising priority by the Provost after consultation with the Office of Development about those sources.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Request</strong><br> The Requestor initiates the process by completing the on-line Request for <a href="https://stanford.box.com/s/06lv8ai2r9zr3zafykg8uvqmltrel5v4" target="_blank">Fundraising Approval and Priority Form</a>. Once the Requestor has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the cognizant Development Officer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Development Officer Review</strong><br> Based on the information provided by the Requestor, the cognizant Development Officer completes the next section of the Form, including an assessment of fundraising feasibility and a recommendation regarding fundraising priority. When the Development Officer has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet Officer.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. School Dean/Cognizant Cabinet Officer Review</strong><br> Based on the information provided by the Requestor, and the cognizant Development Officer, the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer completes the next section of the Form. At this point, the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer may (1) approve the Request and provide a recommendation regarding fundraising priority, (2) return the Request and ask for additional information, or (3) deny the Request. If the Request is approved, the Form will be automatically routed to the Office of the Vice President for Development. If the Request is denied or returned for additional information, the Form will be automatically routed back to the Requestor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Office of the Vice President for Development Review</strong><br> Based on the information provided by the Requestor, cognizant Development Officer, and School Dean or cognizant Cabinet Officer, the Vice President for Development (or his or her designee) completes the next section of the Form, including his or her own assessment of fundraising feasibility and recommendation regarding fundraising priority. When the Office of the Vice President for Development has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the Office of the Provost.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Provostial Review</strong><br> After a Request has been approved by the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer, and the Office of the Vice President for Development, and forwarded to the Office of the Provost, the Provost or the Provost's designee, in consultation with such individuals and/or committees as the Provost may designate, will review the Request using the following criteria:<br> <strong>(1) Academic justification</strong><br> How closely does the project relate to the academic plans of the department, the school, and the University?<br> <strong>(2) Budgetary impact</strong><br> Would funding the project by means of gifts offset existing demands on general funds budgets? Would the project require general funds support, cost sharing, or other immediate financial obligations? Would the project place future financial obligations on the University once the gift or grant funds have expired?<br> <strong>(3) Fundraising potential</strong><br> How many prospective donors exist for the project and to what extent would it compete with other projects of interest to such donors?</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Provostial Decision</strong><br> After weighing these factors the Provost or the Provost's designee will (1) approve the Request with an assigned priority, (2) return the Request and ask for additional information, or (3) deny the Request. The designation of a priority determines the level of effort expected from the Development staff. Such priority designations will also assure that donors are presented with the University's most important projects.<br> <strong>(1) Approved with High Priority</strong><br> Funds for projects awarded this priority will be actively sought, both by school and unit development staff and by the central Office of Development. The Office of Development will work with school and unit development staff to identify and solicit prospects for high priority projects and will enlist volunteers and faculty support as needed, taking into account other project(s) in which prospects may also be interested. Clearance to approach specific prospects is required under <a href="/4-3-1">Guide Memo 4.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Operating Policies for Development.<br> <strong>(2) Approved with Standard Priority</strong><br> Fundraising for projects with this priority must be in the form of specific proposals to particular prospective donors or on a noncompetitive "target of opportunity" basis. Fundraising, including identification and solicitation of prospects, will primarily be handled within the school or unit, subject to clearance of prospect access under <a href="/4-3-1">Guide Memo 4.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Operating Policies for Development. The central Office of Development may, at the discretion of the Vice President for Development, initiate further activity and provide assistance in identifying additional prospective donors.<br> <strong>(3) Approved with Minimum Priority</strong><br> Fundraising projects with this priority must not compete with fundraising for other projects. In most cases, this will mean that fundraising will be limited to corporations and foundations that have an identified programmatic interest in the project, and except in the most unusual cases must not include approaches to alumni, parents, and friends. Fundraising must be handled exclusively by the school or unit, without any assistance from the central Office of Development. As always, clearance to approach any specific prospect is required under <a href="/4-3-1">Guide Memo 4.3.1</a>: Operating Policies for Development.<br> <strong>(4) Denied</strong><br> No gifts may be solicited for projects for which fundraising approval has been denied. Requestors may wish to consider other funding sources as outlined in <a href="/4-5-1">Guide Memo 4.5.1</a>:&nbsp;Funding New Programs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Development Action</strong><br> After a project has been approved and assigned a priority, the Provost will send the Request for Fundraising Approval and Priority form describing the project to the Office of the Vice President for Development for distribution to the fundraising staff. At the discretion of the Vice President for Development, a fundraising coordinator for the project may be appointed. The Development Office will periodically review its list of approved and rated projects in order to recommend changes to the Provost based on fundraising results.</p>

                   <p>There are a variety of funding sources and strategies that may be considered depending on the nature of the proposed new program, project, or activity.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. External Funding</strong> — External funding sources include gifts, sponsored projects, and affiliate programs. All required approvals should be secured before seeking external funding.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Gifts from Individuals, Foundations, Associations, or Corporations</strong> — Approval under Administrative <a href="/4-4-1">Guide Memo 4.4.1</a>:&nbsp;Fundraising Approval and Priority-Setting, is required before any gifts are solicited.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Sponsored Project</strong> — Approval under <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/sponsored-project-proposals/preparation-review-and-submission-sponsored-project-proposals">Research Policy Handbook&nbsp;Document 14.1</a>, Preparation, Review, and Submission of Sponsored Project Proposals, is required before submitting any sponsored project proposal.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Proposals should take into account not only the budget required for the project itself, but also its institutional impacts on Stanford University. Given budget, General Use Permit (GUP), and other constraints, Stanford cannot commit itself to support a project unless all such impacts have been considered and approved in advance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Incremental Faculty Billets</strong> — New billets cannot be created and filled unless authorized by the President/Provost's Office.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Incremental Staff Positions</strong> — New billets cannot be created and filled unless authorized by Deans, Directors or Vice Presidents, or their designees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Incremental Graduate Students and Post-docs</strong> — New billets cannot be created and filled unless authorized by a member of the Executive Cabinet.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Space and Facilities Needs</strong> — All requests for new space or reallocations of existing spaces at Stanford are required to be submitted on the&nbsp; <a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/architect/space_management">Space Management and Planning - Online Space Request Form</a>. If the project cannot be housed within pre-identified existing available departmental or laboratory space, approval to use other existing space must be sought and obtained under <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/sponsored-project-proposals/university-commitments-pertaining-sponsored-project-proposals">Research Policy Handbook, Document 14.3, Section 2</a>. If the project requires new construction (including temporary structures), building or interior space demolitions, building renovations, and/or other infrastructure projects as described in the <a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/publications/facilities-project-initiation-policy-form-1">Form 1 Policy</a>, approval must be sought and obtained via the electronic <a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/form_1_system">Facilities Initiation Form 1</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Other Impacts</strong> — Approvals may also be necessary in the following areas:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Library resources</li>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="authority-to-commit-university-funds"><span class="prefix-container">1. </span>Authority to Commit University Funds</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, which has responsibility for all University funds, including those received under grants and contracts and those originating with other outside sources, has delegated authority for the acquisition and disposition of property and the expenditure of University monies to various University officers and officials (see <a href="/3-2-1">Guide Memo 3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures).</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Department Administrators</strong><br> Department administrators in Schools and Departments have the authority to approve the commitment and expenditure of funds for a given purpose and against specific accounts for which they have been officially delegated authority (see<a href="/3-2-1"> Guide Memo 3.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Authorizing Expenditures). For the purposes of this Guide Memo, this action usually takes the form of a Purchase Requisition.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Procurement</strong><br> Procurement, part of Stanford's Financial Management Services organization, is authorized to execute contracts and place orders for goods and services, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition (see [1.a.] above). With the exception of certain delegations, Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Purchases by University Departments</strong><br> Procurement has delegated authority to departments to approve the acquisition of goods or services when the total dollar value of the transaction is less than $25,000 per transaction and does not require a contract or is less than $5,000 on a Purchasing Card transaction. (See <a href="/5-3-3">Guide Memo 5.3.3</a>:&nbsp;Purchasing Cards.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Unauthorized Purchases</strong><br> No person not authorized in writing by Stanford may commit Stanford funds to purchase goods or services. If an unauthorized person attempts to commit University funds, Stanford may consider the acquisition effort null and void and decline to pay any invoice that might be issued. Stanford officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Procurement Officer, and those to whom the Chief Procurement Officer has delegated authority, including operations managers, supervisors and buyers, may refuse to ratify such transactions. In such a case, the supplier may look to the individual placing the order for payment or reimbursement.</p> 
                   <p>Purchases made without an approved Oracle purchase order number will be flagged and Procurement will contact the requestor for review. Further non-compliance will result in written notice to requester, approver, and the appropriate school or department financial manager. A third instance of non-compliance will result in written notice to the Head of the Administrative Department or the Senior Associate Dean of Finance and Academic Dean of the School, and may result in suspension of Oracle privileges and Purchasing Card use.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Personal Expenses</strong><br> Personal expenses and purchases that are not made on behalf of the University or for use by the University are not permitted. These may be considered fraudulent transactions. Purchases must be for the use and benefit of Stanford University, regardless of intent to reimburse Stanford. If any Stanford user associated with the purchase commits purposeful fraudulent or other inappropriate behavior regarding the proper use of the requisitioning and purchasing process, it will be considered serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The University's policy is that acquisition of products or services will be by competition between potential suppliers, to the maximum practical extent subject to the requirements of quality, price and performance. Attestation of price reasonableness should be acquired prior to submitting any requisition for approval. This is the responsibility of the requestor. Therefore, individuals that request goods and services are responsible for attaining and documenting their efforts related to purchases requests. Requestors may elect to do one or more of the following to ensure and/or document price reasonableness:<br> <strong>a.</strong> Solicit competitive bids<br> <strong>b. </strong>Compare pricing across suppliers<br> <strong>c.</strong> Document justification for a single source or sole source (a single source is a supplier specifically selected amongst others, due to superior compatibility, quality, service, support, continuity, etc.; a sole source supplies a product or service for which there is no alternative supplier). The source justification should include the following information:<br> <strong>1)</strong> A specific description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs, and a statement of facts that show the unique qualifications of the services or items selected to satisfy those needs.<br> <strong>2)</strong> A description of efforts made to locate other sources of supply.<br> <strong>3)</strong> Documentation that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable. This can be a comparison of prices when the item is generally available or, when the item is to be specially fabricated, an analysis of the manufacturer's cost.<br> <strong>4) </strong>Any other information supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Policies</strong><br> All procurement activities must conform to the University Code of Conduct (<a href="/1-1-1">Guide Memo 1.1.1</a>), Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (<a href="/1-5-2">Guide Memo 1.5.2</a>), and Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (<a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conflicts-commitment-and-interest/faculty-policy-conflict-commitment-and-interest">Research Policy Handbook 4.1</a>). Any known or apparent violation of these policies, whether by an employee or a supplier, must be immediately reported as directed in these policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Personal Purchases</strong><br> Procurement does not arrange personal purchases for Stanford faculty, staff or students. The Buyer can render assistance to such individuals only by informing callers of the names of known suppliers. The buyer will spend no time locating suppliers or securing quotations. Similarly, a department may not place an order for an individual employee or student and then have that person reimburse the department.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Stanford provides many goods and services on campus for less than an individual order placed off-campus would cost. A department needing a product or service provided by a Stanford source should order from a Stanford organization that provides it. If Procurement receives a requisition from a department for an item available at Stanford, the buyer may forward the requisition to the appropriate Stanford organization or require the department to place an order that can be processed without the assistance of a buyer.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Stanford University receives many government grants and contracts for academic research. In carrying out its sponsored projects, Stanford fulfills the agreement's conditions, some of which are stated in the sponsored project agreement, others in statutes, regulations and policy statements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Terms and Conditions</strong><br> A grant or contract often requires Stanford to include certain contractual clauses in purchase orders or subcontracts issued under the award. Procurement determines which contractual clauses are appropriate for inclusion in individual contracts. Purchase orders should be placed through the Procurement department to ensure compliance with Stanford's purchasing policies and legal requirements.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Prior Approval</strong><br> If a government sponsored project agreement is a funding source, a government representative may be required to approve a proposed purchase of capital equipment or complex goods or services before the buyer places the order. See the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual">Property Administration Manual</a> for prior approval procedures.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) </strong>Offices Needing Documentation<br> The requesting department is responsible for maintaining records of approval documentation. When required, Purchasing or Accounts Payable may request copies of such documents.<br> <strong>(2) </strong>Subcontracts<br> If the purchase requires government approval of subcontract provisions, the buyer will obtain necessary approval and keep it in the Procurement Office files.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Pre-Acquisition Screening</strong><br> The U.S. Government Office of Management and Budget Circular A-110 and other government regulations that cover the administration of agreements with federal government agencies require that Stanford screen the existing inventory of capital equipment for availability before ordering capital equipment to avoid purchasing "unnecessary or duplicative items."</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Screening Levels</strong><br> The department making the purchase must screen for items of equipment costing between $5,000 and $24,999 at the departmental level before purchase, and items at $25,000 and above at the University level. Equipment costing less than $5,000 need not be screened.<br> <strong>(2) Loans and Transfers</strong><br> Government policy encourages loans or transfers of equipment from other government projects.<br> <strong>(3) Where to Get Help</strong><br> For information on screening procedures, see the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual">Property Administration Manual</a>.</p>

                   <p>Certain transactions require permits or licenses from the federal government. Stanford's customs broker and preferred vendor for outside logistics services provide consultation and assistance as necessary. Procurement will provide contact information for current vendors on request. The permits or licenses most frequently required to transact business are:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Agriculture Permits</strong><br> The Department of Agriculture issues permits for import of certain organisms and biological vectors. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining a permit for each shipment or group of related shipments. The form required by the USDA is VS 16-3.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Import or Export Licenses</strong><br> The Department of Commerce or the U.S. Department of State issues licenses for either export or the importation of equipment or technical data. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining and/or signing the required license.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Duty Free Entry of Scientific Equipment</strong><br> The U.S. Department of Commerce may exempt payment of import duties for scientific equipment. Each department requesting such exemption is responsible for filling out the appropriate paperwork. The form required is ITA-338P.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Radioactive Materials</strong><br> A requisition for radioactive materials must contain a Controlled Radiation Authorization (CRA) number (obtainable from Health Physics) before Purchasing processes the order.</p>

                   <p><strong>a.</strong> "<strong>University financing</strong>" is an internal mechanism whereby the University makes an unsecured loan ("Internal Loan") to a school or department to finance capital projects, programs or purchase equipment and recovers the loan principal, plus interest, over the useful life of the asset by system generated journal entries from a PTA (Project/Task/Award) or PTAs identified by the department. The authorization to borrow is documented in a Funding Agreement for projects that are approved by the Board of Trustees (BOT) and in a Form 1 for other projects. While the asset is owned by the University, the school/department retains all ownership responsibilities, including recording the equipment purchase into the Sunflower Assets System as soon as it is received and in service.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. </strong>"<strong>Amortization</strong>" also referred to as debt service, is the repayment of principal and/or interest over the term of an Internal Loan. For service centers, the principal component of debt amortization payments on a project is treated as a proxy for asset depreciation expense charges and is included in the service centers' rates as such. Interest is charged and principal balances are amortized based on the prior period's ending principal balance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong> "<strong>Religious Use</strong>" means any use including services, meetings and any other activity conducted by or for a religious group or organization in a University facility.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d.</strong> "<strong>Private Use</strong>" generally means the use of tax-exempt-financed property in a trade or business by any person or entity other than the borrower, a 501(c)(3) affiliate of the borrower, or a state or local government entity, and use by the borrower [or any other 501 (c)(3) organization] in an "unrelated trade or business." The use does not have to result in unrelated business income to be considered private use. Private use examples may include but are not limited to: lease of university property to non-university entities; non-compliant management or service contracts (e.g., food service contracts); non-compliant corporate sponsored research agreements; naming rights arrangements with a private user.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e.</strong> "<strong>Substantial Completion</strong>" occurs when an asset is "placed-in-service." An asset is placed in service when one of the following conditions is met (in order of availability and importance):<br> <strong>(1)</strong> issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO)<br> <strong>(2) </strong>signed-off Permit,<br> or<br> <strong>(3)</strong> certification by a Project Manager</p>

                   <p>Once an Internal Loan is approved, the Treasurer's Office and Capital Accounting determine whether the project is eligible for taxable, tax-exempt, or a mix of taxable and tax_exempt debt. If the Funding Agreement or Form 1 indicates that a capital project is designated for academic purposes and tax-exempt debt is allocated to the project, it is implied that there will not be a change in use throughout the life of the project. Penalties may be incurred if religious and/or private use take place in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt. The Treasurer's Office, the Tax Director or the Capital Accounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst in the Controllers' Office should be notified if religious and/or private use in a tax-exempt financed facility is contemplated at any time. Questions regarding Private Use or Religious Use can be directed to the Capital Accounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst.</p>

Certain allocations of debt may be subject to completion of a debt affordability analysis conducted by the Treasurer's Office and approval by the CFO.

                   <p>Bridge financing of gift pledges for capital projects requires prior approval from the Provost and the CFO and must be documented in a Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement addresses financial responsibility during and after construction. See Section 4.f for information on the repayment of Internal Loans, which bridge finance the receipt of gifts.</p> 
                   <p>The Capital Accounting department in the Controller's Office is responsible for processing approval for all capital projects and capital equipment loans.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Capital Equipment Approvals</strong><br> Schools may require approval from the School Dean's Office before committing to finance a capital equipment purchase.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="internal-loan-terms"><span class="prefix-container">4. </span>Internal Loan Terms</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The BOT approves University debt issuances and delegates responsibility to the CFO to issue debt in the capital markets and to advance Internal Loans to schools and departments. The organization responsible for servicing Internal Loans (Paying Organization) and funding sources must be identified at the time of approval and documented in a Form 1 or in a Funding Agreement. The Paying Organization will be responsible for monthly amortization payments (interest and principal) on an Internal Loan over the remaining useful life of the asset being financed. The Treasurer's Office is responsible for the repayment of external debt.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Budgeted Interest Rate (BIR)</strong><br> The University accumulates, by project, in a single fund (Single Interest Fund) all interest expense and bond issuance costs ("Interest") from notes and bonds issued to finance capital projects and programs that support the academic mission of the University. The BIR is the weighted average rate of all Interest related expenditures, including administrative costs, over the projected outstanding debt of the University available for project/program loans during the same accounting period (generally the University's fiscal year). The BIR is charged to the outstanding unamortized Internal Loan principal balance. Notes and bonds or other debt issued to finance activities unrelated to the academic not for profit mission of the University, or issued to finance a specific asset are excluded from the BIR calculation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Taxable Debt Premium</strong><br> If, as a result of management decisions, the project funding structure requires taxable debt when tax-exempt debt would have otherwise been permitted, a 1% interest "Premium" will be assessed. The Premium will be calculated on the Internal Loan principal balance outstanding, it cannot be capitalized and will be charged directly to an operating account until the taxable debt is fully amortized. The Premium is subject to change throughout the internal amortization period. The 1% Premium will be published along with the BIR.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Prepayment Penalty</strong><br> The borrower may incur a prepayment penalty ("Penalty") if debt requested for the project is reduced after the Form 1 or Funding Agreement has been executed. The Premium will be equivalent to (1) interest expense on the corresponding bond obligation until such time as proceeds have been redeployed, or (2) premiums and fees incurred to repurchase the corresponding bond obligation in the open market.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Exceptions to the BIR</strong><br> The BIR is not charged to projects for which construction is in progress (CIP). During CIP and until Substantial Completion, interest on Internal Loans is added to the loan principal balance outstanding and capitalized. During CIP, the interest rate charge is the effective monthly weighted average interest rate computed by Capital Accounting. The intent is to make the capitalized interest expense included in the cost of construction, an accurate component of the total cost of the building, which is then used to calculate depreciation expense for financial reporting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. BIR Calculation</strong><br> Each year in December, or as needed for the general funds forecast, the Treasurer's Office in collaboration with the Capital Accounting group develop a BIR forecast for next fiscal year's budget.</p> 
                   <p>During the course of the fiscal year, the Capital Accounting group compares the effective BIR with the approved BIR. The CFO determines if the variance between effective and approved BIR requires an interim adjustment. In the event of a mid-year reset, the prior months' interest expense will not be restated.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Amortization of Internal Loans</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">In the month following Substantial Completion of a capital project, installation of capital equipment, or the drawdown of an Internal Loan for a program, the Capital Accounting group assesses the BIR on Internal Loan principal balances outstanding and collects principal amortization. Monthly payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR, and amortization proceeds are deposited in the Recycling Pool and used for future internal lending.</span></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Debt service on projects financed with tax-exempt debt must be funded with current operating revenue. The Paying Organization must provide an operating account PTA to be included in the Form 1 or Funding Agreement.</li> 
                    <li>Loans for academic facilities projects and auxiliary programs amortize on monthly level payments (principal payments increase and interest decreases) over the remaining life of the asset or program.</li> 
                    <li>Service Center fixed assets and capital equipment purchases amortize on a fixed principal payment schedule (straight-line amortization) over the remaining useful life of the asset, in order to mimic the asset's financial depreciation expense, which is included in service center rates.</li> 
                    <li>Internal Loans used to bridge finance the gap between construction costs and the receipt of funds, e.g., gifts and pledges, is intended to be short-term financing. Typically, pledges are paid off within three years of the project completion in accordance with a binding schedule.&nbsp;<br> Bridge Financing Loan Terms: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li>If, at any time after Substantial Completion of a project, gifts have not been identified, do not have signed pledge agreements, or will not be received, the CFO will determine whether the school or department financially responsible for the Internal Loan must: 
                       <ul> 
                        <li><strong>(1)</strong> Immediately repay the funds<br> or</li> 
                        <li><strong>(2)</strong> Extend or allow continuation of the bridge loan term.</li> 
                       </ul> </li> 
                      <li>Bridge Financing loans will begin amortizing in the first full month after substantial completion based on an amortization period equivalent to the asset life, with monthly level payments. Additionally, Bridge Financing loans will be fully paid off the earlier of the 60th month after substantial completion or receipt of gift/pledge payments, unless the borrowing school/department receives an approved loan extension from the CFO, in the form of a signed amended Funding Agreement.</li> 
                      <li>Any school/department funds used to pay down the loan during the amortization period may be recovered by the school/department when the pledge(s) are received, once all bridge financing has been paid down, unless otherwise indicated in the Funding Agreement.</li> 
                     </ul> </li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Payment</strong><br> Debt service payments start one month following Substantial Completion. For example, if a project is completed during May, the debt service payment will start in June. The project will be charged capitalized interest in May based on April's ending balance. In June, the project will begin amortizing based on May's ending balance. For purchased equipment (not included in a capital project), the debt service payment starts in the month following the payment for that equipment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Interest</strong><br> The BIR is used to calculate the interest portion of the debt service payments. The BIR may change during a fiscal year. Prior months' interest expense will not be restated. The University reserves the right to make retroactive adjustments to the BIR if required.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Schedules</strong><br> There are two amortization schedules: level payment and fixed principal.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Level payment</strong><br> Internal Loans for academic and auxiliary capital projects are amortized on a monthly level payment schedule over the useful life of the asset being financed. Payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR. The principal component increases over time as the interest component decreases.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Fixed principal</strong><br> Service Center capital projects and all capital equipment purchases are amortized on a fixed principal payment schedule over the life of the asset. Payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR. The interest component fluctuates with the BIR, but the principal component remains the same and is charged straight line, over the useful life of the asset.</li>

The only parties authorized to execute documents that commit Stanford to an equipment lease obligation are the Director of Procurement, the CFO, or their designees. For relevant policies, see section 1 in Administrative <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/5-1-1" rel="nofollow">Guide Memo 5.1.1</a>:&nbsp;Procurement Policies. Approvals, requisition processes and reporting requirements are included.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Leases</strong><br> Leases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash payments for the use of an asset for a specific period of time. For the purposes of this memo, an equipment lease is considered the commitment to pay for the use of an asset for longer than one year, with total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of $5,000 or greater.</p> 
                   <p>Capital and operating leases are considered long-term financial obligations of the University. Therefore, all new equipment leases and lease renewals are considered a use of the University's debt capacity.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Rentals</strong><br> Commitments not meeting these qualifications should be considered rentals that are not subject to this policy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Capital Lease</strong><br> An equipment lease is capitalized if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease, excluding any transportation costs, are greater than or equal to $200,000, on a per contract basis, and at least one of the following criteria is met:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>By the end of the lease term, ownership of the leased property is transferred to Stanford</li> 
                    <li>The lease contains a bargain purchase option that Stanford reasonably expects to exercise</li> 
                    <li>The lease term is substantially (75% of more) equal to the estimated useful life of the leased property</li> 
                    <li>At the inception of the lease, the value of the minimum lease payments is 90% or more of the fair value of the leased property.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Capital leases are reported as an asset and a liability on Stanford's financial statements and interest and depreciation are expensed.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Approvals and Thresholds</strong><br> Equipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of $200,000 and above must be approved by the CFO. Equipment leases with total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease under $200,000 can be approved by managers with requisite expenditure authority in relationship to total contracted cash payments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Approval Forms</strong><br> The Equipment Lease Approval form can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/capitalequip/forms.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Board of Trustees Approval</strong><br> Equipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and above require approval by the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Requisition</strong><br> Following budget approval, departments must submit an online requisition for the total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease to Procurement in Oracle Financials using the Standard Lease category.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Lease Terms</strong><br> Procurement is responsible for negotiating equipment lease terms. Equipment leases must be signed and executed by the Director of Procurement or the CFO.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Reporting Requirements</strong><br> Departmental Property Administrators are responsible for establishing and maintaining property records for leased equipment in the Sunflower Asset Management System. Leased equipment must be tagged and tracked according to the policies of the <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/property-management-office">Property Management Office</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>By September 30 each year, departments must provide the Controller's Office with a certificate and a schedule of all equipment lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the University's financial statements and the property tax-exemption application. Reporting forms for equipment lease obligations can be downloaded from the <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/capitalequip/forms.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Return of Equipment</strong><br> Unless the department wishes to buy the equipment, a memo to Procurement is sufficient to return the item at the end of the lease. Procurement will notify the lessor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Equipment Purchase at the End of the Agreement</strong><br> To buy equipment at the end of a lease, the department must submit a new online requisition, using the Standard Capital Equipment category and referencing the original lease purchase order number.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Receiving Equipment</strong><br> The department must inspect, verify and document the condition of leased equipment when received. Online receiving in Oracle Financials is required for leased equipment. A record for each asset must be entered into the Sunflower Asset Management System within 30 days of receipt.</p> 
                   <p><strong>j. Insurance</strong><br> Stanford's high deductible insurance coverage makes it unlikely that the University's insurance carrier would pay for any loss or damage. Therefore, lessor's insurance for equipment should cover all aspects of damage and injury. For more information, contact the Assistant Vice President of Risk Management.</p> 
                   <p><strong>k. Change of Terms</strong><br> Departments must observe the start and stop dates of the lease. Using the equipment outside the terms of the agreement has significant contractual implications and may subject Stanford to additional rental charges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The lessor's insurance may be valid only during the stated period. To terminate an equipment lease early, the department must contact the assigned buyer in Procurement.</p> 
                   <p><strong>l. Renewals and Extensions</strong><br> Departments must submit an online requisition to Procurement to extend the duration or renew the term of a lease.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Loans of Equipment</strong><br> A loan occurs when Stanford receives free use of equipment. For example, a manufacturer may lend Stanford experimental or prototype equipment that needs testing under regular operating conditions. Even though no payment is involved, other liabilities, such as insurance coverage and repair costs, need to be covered by a loan agreement negotiated, signed and executed by Procurement.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Sponsor-Furnished Property</strong><br> Sponsor-furnished property is a loan of property from a sponsor and managed under the terms and conditions of an existing sponsored award or bailment agreement. The Property Management Office, in conjunction with Office of Sponsored Research, is responsible for ensuring the terms and conditions of the award are followed. Find more information about Sponsor-furnished property at Acquisition chapter, <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual/acquisition/loans-transfers-leases-and-rentals" target="_blank">Section 2.4 Loans, Transfers and Leases</a>, in the Property Management Manual.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Surplus Property Sales Office</strong><br> The mission of the Surplus Property Sales office (SPS) is to sell University property for the best possible price while ensuring responsible handling of excess assets and contributing to campus-wide sustainability initiatives. The Board of Trustees has authorized only SPS to perform this function (Resolution Number 3 September 13, 1983). Therefore, the only entity authorized to sell tangible personal property (hereafter referred to as "property") to non-Stanford entities is SPS.</p> 
                   <p><!-- br-->For the purpose of this document "property" is defined as capital and non-capital movable assets including, but not limited to, equipment and accessories, furniture, vehicles, or supplies.</p> 
                   <p><!-- br-->Specialized sales may include significant involvement by departments, including the identification of a potential buyer. In such cases, the sale must be pre-approved and processed by SPS.&nbsp; The check from the buyer is to be made payable to Stanford University Surplus Sales, and include sales tax, where applicable. All payments must be deposited by Surplus Property Sales.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. University Departments</strong><br> Departments may not give, sell or donate property to individuals, including Stanford employees and students, or to non-Stanford entities, including non-profits. If a department arranges a buyer to purchase property, the sale amount must be approved by SPS.&nbsp; All sale transactions must go through SPS. Departments may transfer property to other departments, either for no charge or for credit to departmental accounts. The property must be used for University business purposes. The <a href="http://reuse.stanford.edu" target="_blank">ReUse website</a> is available to facilitate viewing and posting items available for interdepartmental transfer. The transferring and receiving departments must notify the <a href="https://sparc.stanford.edu/apex/f?p=125:101:10679011573796" target="_blank">Department Property Administrator (DPA)</a> and <a href="https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/property-management-office">Property Service Representative (PSR)</a> of a transfer to ensure asset records reflect the change. Refer to the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual" target="_blank">Property Management Manual</a> for transfer procedures.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Disposition Requests</strong><br> The Department Property Administrator (DPA) initiates an excess request upon notification of excess property.&nbsp; Surplus Sales will determine optimum disposition method for the assets, including potential sale.&nbsp; For specific information refer to Section 4.2, Disposition and Transfers in the Property Management Office (PMO) <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/property-management-pmo#property-management-manual" target="_blank">Property Management Manual</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Sales Terms and Conditions</strong><br> Established terms and conditions apply to all sale transactions. Full description of these is available in Section 4.3, Surplus Property Sales, in the Property Management Manual.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Sales Commission</strong><br> As a self-funded department, SPS retains a percentage of all sales based on the SPS Fee Structure, for purposes of offsetting operating expenses. The SPS Fee Structure is reviewed and approved annually as part of the University's budget process.&nbsp; Refer to Section 4.3, Surplus Property Sales, in the <a href="http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/property-management-pmo#property-management-manual" target="_blank">Property Management Manual</a> for additional details.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Sales Expense</strong><br> Any expenses related to the sale of an item will be deducted from the proceeds of the sale or charged to the department if no sale occurs. Sales expenses may include, but are not limited to: appraisal, advertising, brokerage, or auction fees; diagnostic, registration, smog and repair costs; moving, handling, transportation, and disposal expenses.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Proceeds</strong><br> The proceeds from sales of any University-owned property belong to the University. Sales revenues are distributed in accordance with the approved SPS fee structure.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Delivery</strong><br> Buyers are responsible for timely packaging, removal and transport of the items they buy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Sale Records</strong><br> The buyer may not take possession until payment has been received by SPS. Records of all sale transactions are retained by SPS per University Policy as stated in <a href="/3-1-5">Guide Memo 3.1.5</a>:&nbsp;Retention of Financial Records.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Equipment Inventory Update</strong><br> Property records are updated by PMO as appropriate, to reflect the final disposition transaction.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Non-Marketable Property</strong><br> Items that are broken, inoperable or otherwise deemed unsellable will be disposed or recycled per University policies via the prescribed excess process by Surplus Sales. For equipment items there is no additional cost to departments for this service. For furniture items, such items may be disposed of by departments at their cost with prior approval from PMO.</p> 
                   <p><strong>j. Right of Refusal</strong><br> Surplus Sales may refuse items that are deemed to be in non-marketable condition. Delivery will be diverted to PSSI for disposal at the originating department's expense.</p>

                   <ol> 
                    <li><strong>Contamination Risk</strong><br> Prior to release from the department, property must be decontaminated per Environmental Health &amp; Safety guidelines.&nbsp; A list of items that must be sanitized is available at the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/">Environmental Health &amp; Safety</a> website.&nbsp;<br> Items that require sanitization must have a letter confirming sanitization attached to the unit prior to being picked up or delivered to SPS.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Injury Potential</strong><br> For property with the potential to cause injury, SPS and the department will discuss whether the property should remain with the department pending final disposition, so that only people familiar with the equipment will handle it.</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p><strong>d. Software and Sensitive Data</strong><br> Before delivery to SPS, departments must take steps to permanently remove University proprietary information from any computer or computer peripheral device. See <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/data_destruction_guidelines.html">Secure Computing&nbsp;</a>for a complete description of University policy regarding data sanitization. Special care should be taken with licensed application software to ensure that the terms of the licensing agreement regarding sale or transfer have been observed.</p>

                   <p><strong>Real Estates Leases</strong><br> Real Estate Leases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash payments for the use of real estate for a specific period of time. Real Estate leases are considered long-term financial obligations of the University. Therefore, all new real estate leases and lease renewals are considered a use of the University’s debt capacity.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Background</strong><br> When the academic core campus becomes more space-constrained, academic and administrative units begin to look for options outside of campus boundaries to fulfill their space requirements. While physical planning on campus is centrally managed with rules and guidelines established by the University, locations off campus are subject to a completely different set of jurisdictional regulations and University policies depending upon where a particular property is situated. Prospective off-campus users should be made aware of these respective policies prior to choosing their final space destination. These policies are intended to address the political and economic realities of locating an operation or unit outside the academic core campus.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Off-Campus Leasing Requirements</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>1.</strong> All off-campus users (whether occupying space on Stanford Real Estate Lands or not) are required to:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a) </strong>Confirm their use and/or proposed construction plan confirms with the local zoning code<br> <strong>b)</strong> Understand jurisdictional design and construction review and approval processes<br> <strong>c)</strong> Pay all necessary fees for jurisdictional and University approval (GUP/SIP fees do not apply)<br> <strong>d)</strong> Engage their own resources, including leasing agent, to find space and negotiate the lease<br> <strong>e) </strong>Self-administer leases<br> <strong>f) </strong>Consult with LBRE before removing property from County property tax rolls</p> 
                   <p><strong>2.</strong> If off-campus location is on Stanford Real Estate (SRE) lands, lessee will additionally be required to:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a)</strong> Understand that lessee’s direct landlord may be SRE’s ground lessee and that, in those cases, SRE as well as the off-campus user are obligated to comply with the terms of the existing ground lease document<br> <strong>b)</strong> In all cases (whether or not there is a ground lease between off-campus user and SRE), the off-campus user must obtain SRE approval for all major improvements and exterior changes to land and buildings, as well as any exceptions to jurisdictional zoning regulations<br> <strong>c)</strong> If SRE is direct-owner of the building, obtain SRE approval of all interior improvements; otherwise obtain approval from direct landlord (i.e. SRE’s ground lessee)<br> <strong>d)</strong> Adhere to SRE design guidelines and/or policies for a particular location or district, if applicable (Stanford Research Park Handbook, Stanford Research Park Policy Regarding Medical Clinics, Welch Road Planning Guidelines, etc.)<br> <strong>e)</strong> Understand that market rents will apply and be charged, even for SRE-owned buildings</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Approval Process and Thresholds</strong><br> All real estate leases must be included as a capital request in the Capital Planning Process. The Capital Planning Process is managed by the Vice President for Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate and occurs in conjunction with the annual budgeting process for the University. Departments are required to submit their capital plans &nbsp;for approval as part of this process. Real estate lease searches and/or negotiations initiated outside the Capital Planning Process must be approved by the Vice President for Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate.</p> 
                   <p>All real estate leases require separate approval from (1) the Vice President for Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease are under $1,000,000, or (2), the Provost if the total anticipated contracted cash payments are $1,000,000 or above. Real estate leases with total contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and above require approval by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Requisition</strong><br> Prior to negotiating lease terms, departments must submit an off-campus lease requisition form to the Associate Vice President, Real Estate. The form can be downloaded from the <a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/">Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate website</a>. The Associate Vice President, Real Estate will advise in the search, or direct the requestor to an approved real estate advisor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Approval Forms</strong><br> Prior to executing a lease, departments must submit an off-campus lease approval form to the Associate Vice President, Real Estate. Real estate lease approval forms can be downloaded from the <a href="http://lbre.stanford.edu/">Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate website</a>. After approval of the lease transaction and execution of the lease, departments must request a Purchase Order or BU number from Procurement for the total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease, to ensure proper recording of the transaction and to enable payments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Lease Terms</strong><br> The Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, will assist departments in negotiating lease terms. Real estate leases must be executed by the Vice President for Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate, the Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, or the Administrator designated by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees.&nbsp; Material exceptions to standard terms must be reviewed and approved by the Office of the General Counsel.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Reporting Requirements</strong><br> By January 15 of each year, departments must provide Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate a schedule of all real estate lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the University’s College Exemption property tax filing.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Insurance</strong><br> Lessor’s insurance for real estate leases should cover damage to the building and premises and injury occurring in the building’s common areas. For more information, contact the Director of Risk Management.</p> 
                   <p><strong>i. Change of Terms</strong><br> Departments must observe the start and stop dates of the lease. Occupying the real estate property outside the terms of the agreement has significant contractual implications and may subject Stanford to additional rental charges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The lessor’s insurance may be valid only during the stated period. To terminate a real estate lease early, the department must contact the Associate Vice President, Real Estate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>j. Renewals and Extensions</strong><br> Departments must follow the approval process to extend the duration of the original contract, exercise options included in the original contract, or renew a real estate lease.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The University has implemented the Oracle Financials systems to record its financial transactions. All acquisition transactions, including purchase requisitions, reimbursement requests, purchase orders, invoices, and payments must be entered in the Oracle Financials system. Administrative staff typically use the Oracle iProcurement system for requisition entry and lookup, and the ReportMart system for general financial reporting needs. This system is referred to simply as "Oracle Financials" elsewhere in this and other Guide Memos.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Preparing Transactions</strong><br> Online transactions must be prepared by a person with a SUNet ID and appropriate authority to access the online systems. Stanford faculty, staff, and students acting in an administrative capacity all have access to the online acquisition systems.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Approvals</strong><br> Every requisition is electronically stored and routed on the computer system to a designated person who is an authorized approver for the account to be charged for the acquisition of products or services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Transaction Processing</strong><br> Business transactions are processed through Oracle Financials electronically, which includes forwarding or returning purchase requisitions to personnel with signature authority, obtaining authorized approvals electronically, sending appropriate notifications to users, transmission of orders and related documents to suppliers, and payment for products and services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Personal Expenses</strong><br> Personal expenses and purchases that are not made on behalf of the University or for use by the University are not permitted. These may be considered fraudulent transactions. Purchases must be for the use and benefit of Stanford University, regardless of intent to reimburse Stanford. If any Stanford user associated with the purchase commits purposeful fraudulent or other inappropriate behavior regarding the proper use of the requisitioning and purchasing process, it will be considered serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Getting Started</strong><br> To help employees gain familiarity with the system, classes are offered periodically. Online tutorials are also available.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Approvals</strong><br> In addition to departmental approval, schools may require Dean's Office approval for purchases. A requisition will also be automatically routed to other offices if their approval is needed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Attachments</strong><br> Attachments for requisitions are normally electronically attached to the Oracle iProcurement requisition.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Information Source</strong><br> Departments may obtain information about vendors through lookup in the Oracle iProcurement system, or by contacting Procurement directly.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Soliciting Suppliers</strong><br> After an online requisition of $25,000 or above is made available to Procurement, the assigned buyer works with the requesting department in considering potential suppliers. If written bids, quotations or proposals are appropriate; the buyer prepares and communicates solicitations to prospective suppliers. The buyer and the department select the supplier based on Stanford's policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. External Affirmative Action</strong><br> The University is committed to doing business with small businesses and other targeted concerns when they can supply products or services that meet the University's needs; see <a href="/5-5-1">Guide Memo 5.5.1</a>:&nbsp;External Affirmative Action.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Procurement is authorized to assign a contract number to formal contracts. Unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees or delegated authority from the Chief Purchasing Officer, no other University department may assign contract or purchase order numbers in acquisition of products or services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Contracts</strong><br> A written contract may be appropriate in the following circumstances:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The nature of the work and obligations of the parties must be set out in detail and specificity.</li> 
                    <li>Payment terms are complicated and require special handling.</li> 
                    <li>Equipment being acquired is unusual, unique or special. Examples include situations where design, engineering, testing or other special factors might be risks of the transaction.</li> 
                    <li>For consulting services.</li> 
                    <li>For research.</li> 
                    <li>For construction or installation of fixtures which may expose Stanford to liability to third parties.</li> 
                    <li>For blanket orders (see <a href="/5-3-2">Guide Memo 5.3.2</a>:&nbsp;Blanket Purchase Orders.</li> 
                    <li>For license agreements, rentals and leases; see <a href="/5-2-2">Guide Memo 5.2.2</a>:&nbsp;Equipment and Real Estate Leases.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Modifications</strong><br> When the product, service or terms of acquisition must be changed for the acquisition to meet the University's needs, the department is responsible for initiating an online requisition to authorize the change. Requisitions for change or modification should be promptly processed by University departments. A failure to do so may result in no delivery of the product or service or nonpayment of the supplier.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Delivery Points</strong><br> <strong>(1) General Shipments</strong><br> Most campus shipments are delivered directly to the ordering department by the supplier or shipper. If there are questions or special requirements concerning a delivery, a Procurement buyer can advise on the appropriate manner, place and terms of delivery to be included in an order.<br> <strong>(2) Radioactive Shipments</strong><br> Radioactive materials may not be delivered directly to any department. All shipments of radioactive material go to the Health Physics Inspection Station at 820 Quarry Road for examination by Health Physics and verification of a CRA (Controlled Radiation Authorization) number. After examination by Health Physics, delivery is made or the materials may be picked up by the requesting department. Refer to<a href="/5-1-1"> Guide Memo 5.1.1</a>: Procurement Policies.<br> <strong>(3) Biohazard Shipments</strong><br> Bio hazardous material may be delivered directly to University departments; however, each department is responsible for ensuring that a department representative is available to receive the shipment and for ensuring that safe handling of such products occurs upon delivery. Refer to <a href="/5-1-1">Guide Memo 5.1.1</a>:&nbsp;Procurement Policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Certification of Receipt or Acceptance</strong><br> Receipt of goods or services is entered into the online systems. Receiving transactions are used by Accounts Payable to determine eligibility of a particular invoice for payment. Special circumstances may occasionally require more complex procedures. Requestors should work with the cognizant buyer and Accounts Payable representative to accommodate any special needs.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Expediting</strong><br> Procurement can expedite orders when notified by a department or supplier that an order needs special attention, i.e., a delivery failed to come in as expected, etc.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Claims</strong><br> The University department is primarily responsible for administering shipping claims. If Procurement was involved in the transaction, the buyer can, upon request, assist departments in handling damage claims, return or repair of defective items, and/or return of the item delivered when the wrong product was shipped. For losses or damage over $1,000, the Risk Management Office may be contacted for assistance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. U.S. Customs</strong><br> The buyer assists departments in complying with U.S. Customs, filling out, signing and submitting applications for duty-free entry of scientific instruments, and permits for importation of organisms and biological vectors.<br> <strong>Note: </strong>Procurement uses the services of Stanford's exclusive customs broker and preferred vendor for logistics services, and encourages University departments to do the same. Contact Procurement for more information.</p>

                   <p>If a department frequently needs supplies or services from the same supplier, Procurement may establish a blanket purchase order. Blanket purchase orders are established for varying periods, and allow the department to order directly from the supplier.

For information about approved agencies, call Procurement. To obtain temporary service help from an agency on the approved list, the department enters an appropriate requisition online. The Agency in turn references the approved Purchase Order Number on its invoice. The invoice and a copy of the temporary employee's time sheet (previously approved and signed by the department representative at the end of the employee's work) are sent to Accounts Payable for payment.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Stanford Purchasing Cards (PCards) are university-liability credit cards issued to active, authorized and trained Stanford employees to purchase eligible goods and services in support of Stanford University business. Only eligible business purchases that are $4,999 or less may be charged to the PCard; splitting transactions and personal purchases are strictly prohibited. All PCard transactions must be reviewed and verified in the PCard system and substantiated by adding a <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/resource/guidelines-writing-clear-business-purpose" target="_blank">detailed and appropriate business purpose</a> and proof of purchase documentation. See <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/stanford-purchasing-card-pcard" target="_blank">detailed policy and guidance for the PCard on Fingate</a>.</p> 
                   <p>There are two types of PCards: an individual PCard and a Department PCard. The individual PCard is issued to a specific person who is the cardholder and has direct responsibility for facilitating business transactions for a department. The Department PCard is issued to a department and assigned to an individual custodian, who acts as the cardholder. The custodian may use the card directly to facilitate business transactions for the department or may allow usage of the card by others within the department once verifying that the card will be used in alignment with any department and university policies. The policies are the same for both types of PCards, unless specifically noted.</p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">PCards should be used for smaller dollar items ($4,999 or less). iProcurement, which provides users with access to shop from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/amazon-business-iprocurement" style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">Amazon Business</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/smartmart-iprocurement" style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">SmartMart</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">&nbsp;catalog suppliers, is the preferred method for purchasing goods and services due to the university’s greater ability to manage risk, compliance and regulations. Additional benefits of Amazon Business and SmartMart catalog suppliers include pre-vetted suppliers, pre-negotiated pricing and efficiencies such as repeat ordering and a streamlined invoice and payment process. Using a PCard instead of iProcurement to purchase items should be limited to instances where there is substantial benefit.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Responsibilities</strong></p> 
                   <p>All university business purchases must be substantiated within 60 days of the expense being incurred. For PCard transactions, this means that transactions must be verified (including appropriate documentation, business purpose and account information) <em>and</em> fully approved within 60 days of the charge being available for verification in the Oracle PCard module.&nbsp;A reasonable timeframe for verification is within 10 days of the charge appearing in the module.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Failure to complete verification and approvals within 60 days may result in card suspension and/or expenditures (charges) reported as taxable income to the cardholder or individual custodian.</span></p> 
                   <p>If a PCard transaction is not verified and approved within 60 days, the transaction will be force cleared by Financial Management Services to a department guarantee account (PTA.) This process occurs at the end of each fiscal quarter. The department is then responsible for allocating the force cleared transaction(s), via the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/ijournals" target="_blank">iJournals system</a><u>,</u> to the appropriate account (PTA) and expenditure type.</p> 
                   <p>For information on how to find and manage force cleared PCard transactions, visit <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/managing-aging-and-outstanding-expense-transactions">Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions</a> on Fingate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Verification and Approvals</strong></p> 
                   <p>Cardholders may verify their own transactions. However, all transactions must route to an approver that meets the following criteria:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.5in;">1. has authority over the account (PTA) charged,</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.5in;">2. does not report directly or indirectly to the cardholder, and</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:.5in;">3. is not the beneficiary of the transaction.</p> 
                   <p>A detailed description of all roles and responsibilities is available from the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/stanfords-purchasing-card-pcard-program" target="_blank">Purchasing Card (PCard) overview on Fingate</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Misuse</strong></p> 
                   <p>Participation in the PCard program is considered a privilege that carries the responsibility to ensure appropriate use and stewardship of University funds. Inappropriate use of the PCard may result in the loss of the privilege, disciplinary action and/or in termination of employment. Fraudulent use may additionally result in criminal prosecution. The cardholder/custodian or card user will be held personally liable for all unauthorized purchases.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Accounts Payable pays invoices in accordance with payment terms negotiated or secured by Procurement. Departments must ensure that all purchase commitments (those appropriately executed through iProcurement) are made only with approved, Oracle-generated purchase orders.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Invoices that do not reference an approved Oracle-generated purchase order number will initiate an audit.</li> 
                    <li>To correct invoices without a valid purchase order number, requesters must instruct suppliers to resubmit invoices referencing an approved Oracle-generated purchase order number.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Accounts Payable may, at its discretion, verify receipt or acceptance of products or services before paying any invoice.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Purchase Orders</strong><br> Marking the item as received in Oracle Financials indicates to Accounts Payable that the invoice may be paid.<br> <strong>(1) Items Requiring Certification of Receipt or Acceptance</strong><br> Accounts Payable does not pay the invoice until evaluation has been completed and the item has been accepted (see <a href="/5-3-1">Guide Memo 5.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Requisition Processing).<br> <strong>Note: </strong>The department should <strong><em>not </em></strong>mark the item as received in Oracle Financials until it is accepted.<br> <strong>(2) Capital Equipment and High Value Noncapital Purchases</strong><br> For capital equipment and noncapital purchases of $5,000 or more, Accounts Payable requires approval through Oracle Financials before paying the invoice.<br> <strong>(3) Low Value Noncapital Purchases</strong><br> For noncapital purchases over $5,000, Payment Services requires department approval. This approval can be made with a signature on the invoice, by receiving in Oracle Financials, or by email response to Accounts Payable's hold notification.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Blanket Purchase Orders </strong><br> <strong>(1) Verification</strong><br> Accounts Payable will start the payment process for the transaction upon receiving an invoice listing the blanket order number.<br> <strong>(2) Void Transactions</strong><br> Accounts Payable will not pay any invoice that exceeds the not-to-exceed total of the blanket purchase order.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Price Differences Between Invoice and Purchase Order</strong><br> For a number of reasons, the invoiced amount may differ from the dollar amount approved on the purchase order or service contract. If the invoice amount exceeds the amount on the purchase document, the Accounts Payable processor is authorized to pay the invoice amount without a written change order only on a standard purchase order where the difference is not more than 10% of the purchase order amount and the total difference does not exceed $250.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Periodic Payment Orders</strong><br> <strong>(1) Purpose</strong><br> A Periodic Payment Order authorizes Accounts Payable to make a fixed payment at fixed intervals for a specific period of time. This method is useful for equipment rental or maintenance, where the charge remains constant unless something unusual occurs.<br> <strong>(2) Schedule</strong><br> A Periodic Payment Schedule is established by Procurement in consultation with the requesting department and supplier. Under a periodic payment order the requesting department's responsibilities include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Verifying that Accounts Payable pays only valid charges for services or goods the department receives.</li> 
                    <li>Maintaining records for audit purposes.</li> 
                   </ul>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Prompt Payment Required</strong><br> Federal and state regulations require Stanford to pay all freight bills within 7 days of receipt. Accordingly, departments must send the freight bill to Accounts Payable as soon as received.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Terms</strong><br> Procurement attempts to negotiate standard terms of Free on Board ("FOB") Destination. That means the title and risk of loss of the item are passed to Stanford upon delivery of an item at Stanford or any other specified destination. If those terms are not acceptable to the vendor, Procurement negotiates to have the vendor prepay transportation charges and add them as a separate charge on the invoice. However, if shipping charges are not known and not included on the issued purchase order, the vendor may prepay freight and separately invoice for shipping costs.<br> <strong>(1) Payment for Freight Delivery Under a Purchase Order</strong><br> If any department receives a freight invoice for a product obtained under an issued purchase order, a department representative should forward it promptly to Accounts Payable for payment, ensuring that the purchase order number is clearly noted on the invoice.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Visa Requirements</strong><br> All offers of reimbursements, travel payments or honoraria to foreign visitors are contingent on the visitor entering the United States on a visa that allows the visitor to receive payments (see <a href="/2-4-1">Guide Memo 2.4.1</a>: Visas for and Employment of Foreign Nationals.<br> <br> <strong>(1) Honoraria</strong><br> Visitors with J-1 visa status may be paid honoraria but visitors with non-Stanford sponsored visas must have written permission from their sponsoring officer for payment. Visitors with B-1, B-2, WB or WT status may be paid honoraria if:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The event lasts no more than nine days, and</li> 
                    <li>Services are a direct benefit to Stanford, and</li> 
                    <li>The visitor has not received payment from more than five institutions in the past six months.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Travel Expenses</strong><br> Visitors from countries that have agreements with the U.S. to waive visitor visas (WB and WT) and visitors with J-1, H-1, B-1 or B-2, or A-1/A-2 visa status may be reimbursed for business travel expenses. Visitors with B-2 visas or WT status must conform to the restrictions listed in (1) above.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Tax Information</strong><br> <strong>(1) All Visitors</strong><br> For non-payroll payments to foreign visitors holding valid visas, the department must submit a Declaration of Tax Status (Stanford Form LA-6), and copies of passport, visa and I-94 card with the Oracle Financials reimbursement request. See <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/inviting-and-paying-foreign-visitors">Requesting Payment section of Inviting and Paying Foreign Visitors</a>.<br> <em>Note:</em> all confidential documents and data, including that listed above, should be submitted via the secure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/suppliers/getpaid/supplier_request.html">Supplier Request Portal</a>.<br> <br> <strong>(2) Visitors from Treaty Countries</strong><br> If the visitor's country of residence has a treaty with the U.S. ,the following forms may also be required, depending on what type of payment is proposed:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8233.pdf">Internal Revenue Service Form 8233</a>:&nbsp;Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual for honoraria or services.</li> 
                    <li>Certificate of California Residence, if applicable. Note that a tax treaty applies only to Federal taxes and does not exempt an individual from California withholding taxes.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The Travel section of the <a href="http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/travel/forms.html">Gateway to Financial Activities</a> website contains links to printable versions of most of these forms.<br> <strong><em>Note: </em></strong>Form 8233 and all banking or otherwise confidential data should be submitted via the secure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/suppliers/getpaid/supplier_request.html">Supplier Request Portal</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Tax Identification Number</strong><br> An Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) is necessary if the payment is for an honorarium and the visitor is claiming a tax treaty by submitting the appropriate exemption form (see Section 5.b.(2) above).<br> <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Tax Identification Numbers, Social Security Numbers and all banking or otherwise confidential data should be submitted via the secure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/suppliers/getpaid/supplier_request.html">Supplier Request Portal</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Withholdings</strong><br> If there is no Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), 30% taxes will be withheld from honoraria payments. If there is no tax treaty, 30% taxes will be withheld from honoraria payments (see Section 5.b.(2) above).</p>

                   <p><strong>a. California Withholding at Source</strong><br> Payments to an individual who is not a California resident are subject to California withholding at source tax. California law requires that Stanford (the "source" of the payment) withhold 7 percent from payments for non-employee personal services made to an individual who is not a California resident, if the aggregate total of such payments to that individual during a calendar year is greater than $1,500 and services were performed in California.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. California Residency Status</strong><br> In general, non-employee, non-corporate individuals without a California address, DMV driver's license, or other sufficient evidence of California residency, who will perform their services over a period of fewer than nine consecutive months, will be presumed to be non-California residents unless they submit a Certificate of California Residence (see below).</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Certificate of California Residence</strong><br> If an individual claims exemption from California withholding at source on the grounds that he or she is a California resident, no California withholding will be taken from payments that are made after the following procedure has been completed:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The individual claiming to be a resident must complete California Form 590 (Certificate of California Residence).</li> 
                    <li>The original must be submitted with the invoice.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Form 590 is valid for one year; a new form must be completed for a subsequent year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Mandatory Communication</strong><br> The host department administrator must advise any out-of-state visitor in writing and in advance of the requirements in this section.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Definition</strong><br> Supplemental Research Support is payment for research support made by a department to an individual who is not a Stanford employee. Such payments must meet the following criteria:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Purpose of the payment is to assist the individual in the accomplishment of research for the individual's own purposes.</li> 
                    <li>The University has no direct interest in the research (other than its general interest in the advancement of knowledge in all fields).</li> 
                    <li>The payment in no way represents compensation for the past, present, or future services rendered by the individual to the University.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Tax Status</strong><br> Supplemental research support is treated in all respects as a fellowship for tax purposes. Fellowships paid to non-degree seeking individuals are taxable.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Procedure</strong><br> Supplemental research support payments to visiting scholars are authorized through the Payroll Office.</p> 
                   <p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Supplemental research support to a Stanford faculty or staff member must be processed as supplemental salary.

                   <p><strong>a. Purpose of Expense Advances</strong></p> 
                   <p>The use of cash advances is expected to be rare, but may be appropriate to further University business under certain circumstances including:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Paying for travel (e.g., airfare or pre-paid lodging) for students, staff, and faculty who travel infrequently on University business,</li> 
                    <li>Funding incentives for Human Subjects, or</li> 
                    <li>Financial hardship</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>As a preferred alternative to an expense advance, the University has a travel card program described on the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/travel/travel_card_stanford.html" target="_blank">Gateway to Financial Activities </a>website. Any other advance request not explicitly listed above is considered an exception and requires prior approval by the Business Expense Manager within &nbsp;Procurement Services. The University does not allow expense advances for personal reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Authorizing and Issuing Funds</strong><br> Expense advances are authorized by departments, and are issued to the individual who will be incurring expenses. Responsibility for the University funds remains with the individual until expenditures are accounted for through an expense report in the Expense Requests system.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Amount of Expense Advances</strong><br> The amount advanced may not exceed the estimated cash required for the activity. All advances for travel must include supporting documentation detailing the estimated travel expenses.</p> 
                   <p>Human Subject incentives greater than $200 per subject cannot be advanced and must be processed as a direct non-purchase order payment in the Expense Requests system.</p>

                   <p><strong>b. Timing of Request</strong><br> Approved expense advances must be received by the Business Expense department at least 10 working days before the date the funds are needed. Fees will be charged for expedited (“Rush”) delivery of funds or if pickup at the "Will Call" window is requested.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Delivery of Funds</strong><br> Checks for expense advances may be delivered by interdepartmental mail to the department, sent via U.S. Mail, deposited directly to the payee's bank account, or picked up at designated “Will Call” locations.</p>

Expense Reporting</strong><br> An expense report must be submitted in the Expense Requests system no later than 60 days after the completion of the activity (e.g., trip) in order to clear advances. Absent exceptional circumstances, expenses submitted more than 60 days after the date of completion will be reported as taxable income to the individual.

                   <p><strong>b. Returning Unused Funds</strong><br> Unused funds, and funds that are no longer needed, must be promptly returned to the University.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>If an advance is outstanding more than 60 days past the expected clearing date, the advance will be reported as taxable income to the individual to whom the advance was intended. In this circumstance, the advance will be<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;expensed to the account specified in the advance request.

                   <div> 
                    <div>
                     In order for Stanford to be able to provide support to its faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students when they are traveling on university-sponsored business, the university requires the use of a centralized booking program as described in the Travel Policy below. This method connects travel reservations automatically to the university’s Travel Registry, enabling Stanford to locate its employees and students in an emergency and/or provide assistance as needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                     &nbsp;
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                     In most cases, use of the university’s centralized booking program results in reduced travel-related costs. However, as travel pricing is dynamic, there are times when a fare or rate may not reflect the least expensive price. In these cases, the ability for the university to support its travelers supersedes the need to purchase the cheapest travel fare or rate. The university continually evaluates its relationships with travel booking partners to ensure that services are provided at reasonable cost and are generally consistent with those offered by other commercial booking sources.
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                     &nbsp;
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                     In addition, at a holistic level, the university can more efficiently steward its resources through the centralized booking program by reducing the administrative burden related to payment and reimbursement processes and tools, time searching for cost comparisons, and effort tracking the needed documentation.&nbsp;

As such, individuals using University resources for business, travel expenses, and/or to purchase items to be owned by Stanford share the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are used appropriately, support the University mission, and comply with University policies, applicable laws and regulations, and sponsor and donor restrictions.</span>

                     <li>Reasonable means that the nature and amount of the expense does not exceed that which a prudent person would incur under the same circumstances. While these amounts may vary, a good test is whether the individual could defend the expense if it came under public scrutiny.&nbsp;</li> 
                     <li>A necessary expense is one that supports and furthers the University mission and its ongoing operation.</li>

                    <div>
                     The university has established limits on maximum university reimbursement for specific types of business and travel expenses, including meals, air and ground transportation, and hotel lodging. The limits, details and associated processes for these reimbursements are available on the <a href="https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/business-and-travel-expense-policies" target="_blank">Fingate website</a>. It is the responsibility of the individual incurring expenses, as well as those who assist others with incurring expenses and those involved in the preparation and approval of reimbursement requests or financial transactions, to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to the reimbursement policies. For more information on these various roles and responsibilities, see <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-3/subchapter-2/policy-3-2-1">AGM 3.2.1: Responsibility for University Funds</a>.

                   <div>
                    To ensure the safety of the Stanford community, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students must engage in thoughtful planning of their travels well in advance and fully utilize the university resources that are available to them. Before purchasing or booking travel, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students must ensure compliance with university, local, state and federal guidelines, as well as with all relevant regulations in their travel destination.&nbsp;

                    <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">University-sponsored travel is defined as when the university pays directly or reimburses individuals for travel expenses that are necessary and appropriate to conduct university business. This includes the use of any funding source for which the university has financial responsibility and accountability, including operating budgets, donor gifts, federally-sponsored grants and awards, and any other restricted or unrestricted fund. Student and postdoctoral scholar travel that is directly related to their individual course of study,&nbsp;</span>or for which academic credit may be awarded,&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">is considered university-sponsored travel, even if the travel is funded via their base financial support.</span></p> 
                    <div>
                     University-sponsored travel may occur within or outside of the local area. Travel is considered outside of the local area when the destination is 50 miles or more one way from the traveler’s home or Stanford’s historic campus, whichever is greater. This definition is applicable to some travel expense policies, for example, hotel lodging reimbursement, where the university will only pay for hotel lodging expenses when the trip is outside of the local area.

Therefore, in order to enable the university to locate and support its travelers in the event of an emergency, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students traveling on behalf of the university must utilize the centralized travel booking program to book air travel, hotel lodging and car rental reservations.&nbsp;</span>

Without the pre-approval, it will be returned to the preparer and would require an approval from the Dean, Vice Provost, or Vice President of the school/unit and PTA award owner to be processed.&nbsp;

                     <p>If it is not easy to separate out the costs that will be covered by the external party, the Stanford Travel Card may be used to pay for the total cost of the trip, then Stanford must be reimbursed by the traveler or travel arranger for the external party portion.

                      There are some circumstances where faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students are not required to book airfare, hotel lodging and rental car through Stanford Travel booking channels, such as:&nbsp;

                        Generally, the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) is the preferred payment method for travel costs. Alternatively, personal funds may be used and a request for reimbursement can be submitted after the trip.&nbsp;

                        When a personal component of travel is added to a business trip, the university will only pay for or reimburse the costs of the business component. The charge that would have been incurred without that personal component must be documented at the time of booking in order to appropriately process the reimbursement.

                        The Travel Card may be used to pay for trips that include a component of personal travel that may not be easily separated from the booking, but it may not be used to purchase trips that are exclusively personal. In cases where the Travel Card is used to purchase trips with a personal component, the individual is responsible for reimbursing the university for the extra cost.

                         Stanford University may strongly recommend against or restrict travel to or within countries where the U.S. Department of State has issued certain official Travel Advisory levels, where there is other reliable information of significant health or safety risks, and/or where exigent circumstances apply. Detailed guidance can be found in the <a href="https://provost.stanford.edu/2017/03/03/international-travel-policy-2/">Stanford International Travel Policy</a>. When planning travel, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students should first review traveler health and safety guidelines as well as information about any travel restrictions on the <a href="https://international.stanford.edu/">Office of International Affairs</a> and <a href="https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/">Environmental Health &amp; Safety</a> websites.

                   <p>The University reimburses individuals under the IRS Accountable Plan when the IRS regulations are met. Under this plan, the reimbursement is not taxable as income to the employee if the expense has a business connection and is also submitted in a timely manner (see sections below). In addition to expenses being reasonable and necessary, the requirements for reimbursement under the IRS Accountable Plan include the following:</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">a. Business Connection and Substantiation of Expense&nbsp;</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Expenses incurred must have a&nbsp;business connection; that is, they must have been paid or incurred while performing Stanford business. The business connection must be adequately explained and documented in the University’s records. Documentation must include:</p> 
                   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 40px;"> 
                    <li style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">The <strong>Business Purpose, </strong>which should clearly and without need for interpretation: 
                     <ol>

                      <li>Include <strong>sufficient documentation</strong> to support the business purpose and alignment to the purpose of the funds, such as <strong>agendas or travel itinerary. </strong></li>

                   <p style="list-style-type: lower-roman; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Expenses should be submitted immediately and no later than 60 days after being incurred (e.g., return date from trip), or a reasonable explanation must be provided for an exception to be granted. Reimbursable expenses that are submitted after 60 days will be reported as taxable income to the IRS.</span></p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The purpose of a Petty Cash Fund is to allow for the reimbursement or purchase of minor, small-dollar (less than $100), unanticipated business expenses, where the use of alternative means is neither feasible nor cost effective. In general, departments are strongly encouraged to use Stanford Purchasing Cards or to request reimbursement through the Expense Requests system rather than use petty cash, whenever possible. whenever possible.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="principles"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Principles</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <h3>a. Authority</h3> 
                   <p>The Office of the Treasurer is responsible for approving all Petty Cash Fund account requests.</p> 
                   <h3>b. Fund Types and Limits</h3> 
                   <p>The University has three types of Petty Cash Funds. Fund levels should be reassessed annually and modified as needed based on the volume of activity during the year.</p> 
                   <h4>(1) Petty Cash Fund</h4> 
                   <p>Petty Cash Funds are established for departmental use for incidental and emergency small-dollar purchases where the use of alternative means (e.g., Purchasing&nbsp; Card) is not feasible. Reimbursement for properly approved expenses may be obtained directly from this fund. The size of a Petty Cash Fund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting department, but will typically not exceed $500 in cash on hand, unless otherwise approved by the Office of the Treasurer.</p> 
                   <h4>(2) Petty Cash Checking Account</h4> 
                   <p>Petty Cash Checking Accounts may be established in departments that make small disbursements by mail (e.g. purchase of subscriptions), or that must make immediate payment (e.g. C.O.D. (cash on delivery) for goods delivered by UPS). The size of a Petty Cash Checking Account will be based on the business needs of the requesting department, but will typically not exceed $2,500, unless otherwise approved by the Office of the Treasurer.</p> 
                   <h4>(3) Change Fund</h4> 
                   <p>Change Funds may be established by a department, used to give change to customers when they are paying for goods and/or services, and must be reconciled daily. The size of a Change Fund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting department. A written request with the details of the business needs must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Treasurer.</p> 
                   <h3>c. Number of Petty Cash Funds per Department</h3> 
                   <p>Unless the department is very large or geographically dispersed, a single petty cash fund per department is usually adequate. Reimbursements from one petty cash fund may be charged to any type of account including sponsored projects. If more than one petty cash fund is needed, a written justification must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Treasurer.</p> 
                   <h3>4. Petty Cash Custodian</h3> 
                   <p>The department head must appoint an individual to be custodian of the department's petty cash fund. Petty cash custodians must be salaried employees of the University, and may not be undergraduate students, graduate students or temporary personnel. Custodians are required to complete Petty Cash Training.&nbsp; The custodian remains accountable for the petty cash fund until another person is officially designated as the new custodian, or the fund is closed.</p> 
                   <h3>5. Periodic On-Site Audits of Petty Cash Funds</h3> 
                   <p>The Office of the Treasurer may conduct on-site audits of selected department Petty Cash Funds, Petty Cash Checking Accounts and Change Funds each year. The funds will be selected randomly and the custodian for the selected fund(s) will be notified and an appointment to conduct the audit must be made within 72 hours. For an audit, the custodian will need to provide the auditor with evidence of reconciliations, reimbursement receipts showing the types of reimbursements being made with the fund, and provide evidence that the fund is being stored securely when not in use.</p> 
                   <h3>6. Handling of Petty Cash Funds</h3> 
                   <p>Failure to properly safeguard, reconcile and administer petty cash funds may lead to revocation of the petty cash fund from the department and/or disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>

                   <p>Stanford University is committed to increasing significantly the opportunities for minority, women and disabled people to engage in business with the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Purpose</strong><br> This policy statement supports a long-range plan to enhance Stanford's external affirmative action. The plan serves to promote diversity through the judicious use of the University's financial and other resources to increase opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned by targeted concerns to participate in economic opportunities arising from University business activities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Scope</strong><br> The classes covered by this policy, as defined by the Federal Government, include Asian, Black, Latino/Hispanic and Native American, women of all racial/ethnic background, people who are disabled or physically challenged, veterans, and other targeted concerns.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Public Law 95-507 and Executive Order 12138 encourage organizations that receive contracts from federal agencies to do business with small businesses and other targeted concerns regardless of size. The University's responsibilities under these laws are described in detail in the document "Utilization of Small Business Concerns, Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, and Women-Owned Business Concerns," which is published in the Procurement Manual. Specific questions as to applicability to particular situations should be addressed to the Office of Sponsored Research.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Definitions</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>"Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities. The social disadvantage of individuals must stem from circumstances beyond their control." 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(3)(i)</li> 
                    <li>"Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities, as compared to others in the same line of business and competitive market area who are not socially disadvantaged." 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(4)(i)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines the members of these groups. An updated listing can be found online at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-performance/policy-regulations/laws-regulations/code-federal-regulations-cfr/part-124-8a-business-development-small-disadvantaged-business-status-determinations">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>&nbsp;website.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Subcontract: "Any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract." Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 80-2.<br> Under this definition, subcontracting means every purchase order and agreement, as well as other expenses such as travel.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Contracts Affected</strong><br> <strong>(1) Contracts between $25,000 and $499,999</strong><br> Terms of government contracts over $25,000 in value require the University to have a program to insure business opportunities for small and minority owned businesses. Stanford's External Affirmative Action Program meets that requirement.<br> <strong>(2) Contracts $500,000 and over</strong><br> For contracts of $500,000 or more, a specific plan must be made and implemented. A Small Business Liaison Officer (a Stanford-designated University official) oversees the operation of the plan. The University is responsible for establishing percentage goals of subcontracting business (expressed as a proportion of total subcontracting dollars) to be awarded to small and small disadvantaged suppliers. For assistance or information on goals required by specific agencies, contact the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR).</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Procedures</strong><br> <strong>(1) Preparing the Subcontracting Plan</strong><br> When a request for a subcontracting plan is received from an agency, OSR notifies the cognizant department and Procurement. Procurement and the department meet to review product and service areas with subcontracting opportunities, and based on this review, determine reasonable goals for the plan. Procurement submits data for the plan to OSR. Procurement then writes the subcontracting plan and submits it to the government agency.<br> <strong>(2) Vendor Search</strong><br> Departments must investigate small and disadvantaged business possibilities prior to submitting a requisition. Departments that wish further searching to be done by Procurement should so specify in the "Remarks" screen of the requisition, and should attach documentation of the department's search efforts and their results.<br> <strong>(3) Reports</strong><br> The federal government requires periodic reports on progress toward the achievement of goals set in a contract's original subcontracting plan. Procurement prepares reports of purchases under each contract, and notifies departments of progress against goals.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Purposes of Policy</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Establish a policy on privacy in Electronic Information and the circumstances under which Electronic Information may be accessed and/or disclosed without User Consent.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Scope</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">This policy applies to:</span></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All University Information Technology (IT) Resources;</span></li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All Users of University IT Resources, including staff, faculty, students, contractors, volunteers and visitors; and</span></li> 
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All Electronic Information.</span></li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Definitions of terms used in this policy are provided, below, in Section 2.</p> 
                   <p>This policy does not apply to routine use of Electronic Information by those who send and receive Electronic Information in the expectation that the Electronic Information will be used by intended recipients and others in the normal course of their duties. Additionally, a User who holds records for the University may not deny Access to those records to others within the University with a need for those records to conduct University business.&nbsp; Rather, this policy applies to Access to Electronic Information by University officials and others who would not routinely use the Electronic Information but would do so in order to fulfill special conditions of University business, or to respond to legal demands from outside the University, as described in Section 4, Access Without User Consent, below.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Principles</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Communication among members of the Stanford University community is essential for all University operations, teaching, and research. This communication can take many forms, including through the use of University IT Resources. Stanford University encourages the use of University IT Resources to share information and knowledge in support of the University's mission of education, research, and public service, and to conduct the University's business. To this end, the University provides and supports a broad array of electronic communications services and facilities.</span></p> 
                   <p>Because the University provides IT Resources to facilitate electronic communication and data storage, the University could Access Electronic Information and the scope and ease of this Access likely surpasses that which the University has to non-electronic data, cell phone calls, or other personal conversations among its faculty, staff, and students.</p> 
                   <p>This policy therefore sets out guidelines and processes that apply when the University seeks Access to Electronic Information. Our goal is to act in accordance with the University’s legal and ethical obligations, while also seeking to maintain an environment in which free academic inquiry thrives. This policy, along with federal, state, local and, in some circumstances, foreign laws, provides the&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">rules and procedures under which the University may Access and disclose electronic information.</span></p> 
                   <p>Accordingly, the policy is grounded on seven important principles:</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access should occur only for a legitimate purpose;</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access should be authorized by one or more appropriate and accountable people;</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">iii.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as described herein, when the University is subject to a legal process to release a User’s Electronic Information to a third-party outside of the University, it should give Notice to the User before releasing the requested information;</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as described herein, the University should obtain User Consent before a User’s Electronic Information is Accessed;</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access should be limited to the minimum Electronic Information necessary to accomplish the purpose, and the University should take reasonable steps to avoid Access to information on private machines that it has no reason to believe is University information;</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficient records should be kept to enable appropriate review of compliance with this policy; and</span><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">vii.&nbsp; The process for access should be transparent and reviewable by the Steering Committee of the Faculty Senate as described in&nbsp;5.e. (Transparency and Access Records).</span></p> 
                   <p>In general, the University does not Access or disclose Electronic Information without User Consent. The University may Access or disclose Electronic Information without User Consent only under the limited circumstances as described in this policy. Moreover, before releasing a User’s Electronic Information pursuant to legal process, the University will make reasonable efforts to give notice of the third party request.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"><strong>a. Introduction</strong><br> The University recognizes that academic freedom, shared governance, and freedom of speech require personal privacy. This policy seeks to ensure these firmly-held principles within the context of compliance with the University’s legal and other obligations. The University respects the privacy of Electronic Information in the same way that it respects the privacy of paper correspondence and telephone conversations. Simultaneously, the University seeks to ensure that University administrative records are accessible for the conduct of the University's business and seeks to meet its obligations to justify the use of private and public funds, investigate allegations of research misconduct or violation of standards of authorship, conduct fact-finding and remediation for suspected violations of the ethics and law of research using humans and animals, and inquire into and resolve allegations of noncompliance or of misconduct, such as discrimination, harassment, theft, extortion, blackmail, or acts or threats of violence.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">b. Information Available to the University</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">As an Internet service provider, an electronic communications service provider, a back-up provider, a storage provider, and more, the University is capable of accessing Electronic Information generated by User interaction with these services. Even when using personally owned devices, user interactions with University IT Resources generates Activity Data that can often be attributed to an individual while also identifying that person’s physical location to varying degrees of precision. Users should be aware that the University has or could have Access to many categories of information, including but not limited to those described in Appendix B.</span></p> 
                   <p>All Users might be involved in circumstances over the course of their time at Stanford in which Electronic Information could legitimately be accessed by the University under Section 4, Access Without User Consent, below. Therefore, the University advises all Users who use University resources for personal matters that the University might Access Electronic Information pertaining to such matters under this policy. Accordingly, the best protection Users have to keep the University from Accessing private personal matters, is to keep such matters off of University resources. To the extent Users wish to keep private from the University such personal matters, the Users should consider using non-University resources for such matters.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Even under circumstances in which the University may legitimately Access Electronic Information under this policy, it will not disclose such Accessed Electronic Information to third-parties absent Notice of a Third Party Request and/or User Consent, unless (a) required to do so by law or legal process; (b) to protect life or property; or (c) to report a crime relating to or indicated by the Electronic Information.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">c. Privacy Obligations of University Employees and Agents</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">This policy prohibits University employees and their agents from Accessing Electronic Information except in accordance with this policy. University employees shall take necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of personal information encountered either in the performance of their duties or otherwise. University contracts with outside vendors that will have access to personally identifiable Electronic Information shall include references to this policy, to applicable privacy laws that protect the information, or language that limits the third party contractor from using the information for any purpose other than to perform the services of the Agreement, or as required by law.</span></p> 
                   <p>In addition to legal sanctions, violators of this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion, pursuant to University policies and collective bargaining agreements. If a User’s Electronic Information has been Accessed in violation of this policy, the affected individual should be promptly notified.&nbsp; Where such a policy violation also requires a legal notification under an applicable law, the legal notice will serve as the notification required under this section. &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">d. Audio or Video Conversations</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">In compliance with law, conversations shall not be recorded or monitored without advising all participants, unless a court has explicitly ordered such monitoring or recording to occur without notice. Emergency services shall record 911-type emergency calls in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Callers shall be informed when a call is being monitored or recorded for the purpose of evaluating customer service, assessing workload, or any other business purpose permitted by law.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>Except as otherwise provided in this policy, the University will obtain User Consent prior to any Access except under the conditions described below.</p> 
                    <p><strong>a.&nbsp;System Protection, Maintenance, and Management</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">University IT Resources require ongoing maintenance and inspection to ensure that they are operating properly; to ensure they are in compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations; and to protect against security threats such as cyber attacks, malware, and phish. University IT Resources also require regular management, for example, in order to deploy software updates. Accordingly, to perform this work, the University and its approved vendors may scan or otherwise Access Electronic Information without User Consent.</span></p> 
                    <p>The Chief Information Security Officer may authorize Access for System Protection, Maintenance, and Management.</p> 
                    <p>In that process, University IT personnel may observe certain Activity Data or other Electronic Information. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy or by law, University IT personnel are not permitted to seek out Electronic Information, including Contents or Activity Data, when not germane to system operations and support. Any unavoidable examination of Electronic Information shall be limited to the minimum required to perform such duties. This exception does not exempt systems personnel from the prohibition against disclosure of personal or confidential information.</p> 
                    <p>If, in the course of their duties, University IT personnel inadvertently discover or suspect violations of law or University policy listed in Appendix A, such personnel may preserve the data and report such violations.</p> 
                    <p>Where possible, the University will provide minimally invasive tools to manage User devices and adopt minimally invasive tools to monitor network security without unneeded institutional access.</p>

Emergency Circumstances</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The University may Access Electronic Information without User Consent in Emergency Circumstances, in which time is of the essence. One Authorizing Official may authorize Access using the least intrusive means to obtain the information necessary to assess and resolve the emergency. The Authorizing Official should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, integrity of University operations, protection of life and property, and determine that the need for Access outweighs any countervailing considerations.</span></p> 
                    <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">c.&nbsp;</strong><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Compelling Circumstances</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">For Compelling Circumstances, two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the University investigation/purpose has a sufficient basis to support Access without User Consent. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, integrity of University operations, compliance with law and policies listed in Appendix A, protection of life and property, and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations. Only Electronic Information reasonably necessary to assess and/or address the Compelling Circumstances may be accessed or disclosed.</span></p> 
                    <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">d. Operational Circumstances</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The University may Access Electronic Information without User Consent under circumstances in which failure to access the Information would likely cause the University to fail to meet mission-critical governance, administrative, teaching, or research obligations.</span></p> 
                    <p>For Operational Circumstances, two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the operational circumstances have a sufficient basis to support Access without User Consent. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, integrity of University operations and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations. Only Electronic Information reasonably necessary to assess and/or address the Operational Circumstances may be accessed or disclosed.</p> 
                    <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">e. University Investigations</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The University may Access Electronic Information without User Consent in order to conduct a University Investigation of an alleged violation of a legal requirement or a policy listed in Appendix A.&nbsp; Two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information for University Investigations. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the investigation has a sufficient basis to support Access. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, integrity of University operations, compliance with law and policy, protection of life and property, and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations.</span></p> 
                    <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">f.&nbsp;</strong><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The Identity of the User is Unknown</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">The University may Access Electronic Information without User Consent when the identity of the User is unknown in order to investigate violations of law or of the University policy. Once the identity of the User is determined, the University may have an obligation under this policy to obtain User Consent for future Access.</span></p> 
                    <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">g.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Legal Process</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">All requests for Electronic Information arising from legal process, such as search warrants, court orders, national security letters, subpoenas, or other demands related to government investigations or University litigation, must be referred to the Office of the General Counsel or the General Counsel’s designee (OGC). The OGC is responsible for ensuring Notice of a Third Party Request, authorizing Access, and release of Electronic Information under this circumstance.</span></p> 
                    <p>If a person is identified by name in the legal process as the person whose records are being sought, then the University will make reasonable efforts to provide Notice of a Third Party Request to the person/User before Accessing or disclosing Electronic Information and with sufficient notice to enable the User to object in court to the legal request.</p> 
                    <p>Under circumstances in which the University does not have evidence that a User has received a copy of the Court Order or Subpoena, the University will either provide a copy of the request to the User using the cover sheet (or its equivalent) provided in Appendix C or in the alternative will make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide verbal or written communication to an affected User:</p> 
                    <ol> 
                     <li>that an outside party requests that the Users’ Electronic Information be Accessed;</li> 
                     <li>the identity of the requester of the Electronic Information;</li> 
                     <li>the reason for the request, if known;</li> 
                     <li>the scope of Electronic Information subject to the request; and</li> 
                     <li>whether the User’s consent is required before the University will Access the information.</li> 
                    </ol> 
                    <p>A User who does not want information to be released by Stanford should contact the Office of the General Counsel.&nbsp; If University Electronic Information is at issue, the University will work with the User to determine if moving to quash the subpoena is appropriate.&nbsp; If the User’s personal information is at issue (for example, pay records subpoenaed in a personal injury litigation), the User is responsible for moving to quash the subpoena or taking other appropriate legal action to invalidate the legal request to the University.&nbsp; Users in this situation are advised to seek legal counsel for assistance.&nbsp; Students enrolled in degree programs may seek out assistance from the ASSU Legal Counseling Office.</p> 
                    <p>In circumstances in which the University is prohibited from disclosing the existence of legal process compelling disclosure of a User’s information (Gag Order), the Office of the General Counsel in consultation with the Privacy Office will determine whether the University has justifiable grounds to challenge the Gag Order.</p>

                   <p>As used in this policy:<br> <strong>a. </strong>"Information resources" are all computer and communication devices and other technologies which access, store or transmit University or student information.<br> <strong>b.</strong> "Information" includes both University and student information.<br> <strong>c</strong>. "Personally owned resources" are information resources that are under the control of University employees or agents and are not wholly owned by the University.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="policies"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Policies</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. General Policy</strong><br> Users of information resources must protect (i) their online identity from use by another individual, (ii) the integrity of information resources, and (iii) the privacy of electronic information. In addition, users must refrain from seeking to gain unauthorized access, honor all copyrights and licenses and respect the rights of other users of information resources.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Access</strong><br> Users must refrain from seeking to gain unauthorized access to information resources or enabling unauthorized access. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system or to another person's information are a violation of University policy and may also violate applicable law, potentially subjecting the user to both civil and criminal liability. However, authorized system administrators may access information resources, but only for a legitimate operational purpose and only the minimum access required to accomplish this legitimate operational purpose.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Prohibition against Sharing Identities</strong><br> Sharing an online identity (user ID and password or other authenticator such as a token or certificate) violates University policy.<br> <strong>(2) Information Belonging to Others</strong><br> Users must not intentionally seek or provide information on, obtain copies of, or modify data files, programs, passwords or other digital materials belonging to other users, without the specific permission of those other users.<br> <strong>(3) Abuse of Computing Privileges</strong><br> Users of information resources must not access computers, computer software, computer data or information, or networks without proper authorization, or intentionally enable others to do so, regardless of whether the computer, software, data, information, or network in question is owned by the University. For example, abuse of the networks to which the University belongs or the computers at other sites connected to those networks will be treated as an abuse of University computing privileges.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Usage</strong><br> The University is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization and, as such, is subject to specific federal, state and local laws regarding sources of income, political activities, use of property and similar matters. It also is a contractor with government and other entities and thus must assure proper use of property under its control and allocation of overhead and similar costs. Use of the University's information resources must comply with University policies and legal obligations (including licenses and contracts), and all federal and state laws.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Prohibited Use</strong><br> Users must not send, view or download fraudulent, harassing, obscene (i.e., pornographic), threatening, or other messages or material that are a violation of applicable law or University policy. In particular, contributing to the creation of a hostile academic or work environment is prohibited.<br> <strong>(2) Copyrights and Licenses</strong><br> Users must not violate copyright law and must respect licenses to copyrighted materials. For the avoidance of doubt, unlawful file-sharing using the University's information resources is a violation of this policy.<br> <strong>(3) Social Media</strong><br> Users must respect the purpose of and abide by the terms of use of online media forums, including social networking websites, mailing lists, chat rooms and blogs.<br> <strong>(4) Political Use</strong><br> University information resources must not be used for partisan political activities where prohibited by federal, state or other applicable laws, and may be used for other political activities only when in compliance with federal, state and other laws and in compliance with applicable University policies.<br> <strong>(5) Personal Use</strong><br> University information resources should not be used for activities unrelated to appropriate University functions, except in a purely incidental manner.<br> <strong>(6) Commercial Use</strong><br> University information resources should not be used for commercial purposes, including advertisements, solicitations, promotions or other commercial messages, except as permitted under University policy. Any such permitted commercial use should be properly related to University activities, take into account proper cost allocations for government and other overhead determinations, and provide for appropriate reimbursement to the University for taxes and other costs the University may incur by reason of the commercial use. The University's Chief Financial Officer and Vice President for Business Affairs will determine permitted commercial uses.<br> <strong>(7) Use of University Information</strong><br> Users must abide by applicable data storage and transmission policies, including Admin Guide 6.3.1 (Information Security). Consult the University Privacy Officer (<a href="mailto:privacyofficer@stanford.edu?subject=Information">privacyofficer@stanford.edu</a>) for more information.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. </strong><strong>Personally Owned Resources</strong><br> Stanford does not require personnel to use their personally owned resources to conduct University business. Individual units within the University may permit such use, and users may choose to use their own resources accordingly. Any personally owned resources used for University business are subject to this policy and must comply with all Stanford requirements pertaining to that type of resource and to the type of data involved. The resources must also comply with any additional requirements (including security controls for encryption, patching and backup) specific to the particular University functions for which they are used.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Integrity of Information Resources</strong><br> Users must respect the integrity of information and information resources.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Modification or Removal of Information or Information Resources</strong><br> Unless they have proper authorization, users must not attempt to modify or remove information or information resources that are owned or used by others.<br> <strong>(2) Other Prohibited Activities</strong><br> Users must not encroach, disrupt or otherwise interfere with access or use of the University's information or information resources. For the avoidance of doubt, without express permission, users must not give away University information or send bulk unsolicited email. In addition, users must not engage in other activities that damage, vandalize or otherwise compromise the integrity of University information or information resources.<br> <strong>(3) Academic Pursuits</strong><br> The University recognizes the value of legitimate research projects undertaken by faculty and students under faculty supervision. The University may restrict such activities in order to protect University and individual information and information resources, but in doing so will take into account legitimate academic pursuits.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Locally Defined and External Conditions of Use</strong><br> Individual units within the University may define "conditions of use" for information resources under their control. These statements must be consistent with this overall policy but may provide additional detail, guidelines restrictions, and/or enforcement mechanisms. Where such conditions of use exist, the individual units are responsible for publicizing and enforcing both the conditions of use and this policy. Where use of external networks is involved, policies governing such use also are applicable and must be followed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Access for Legal and University Processes</strong><br> Under some circumstances, as a result of investigations, subpoenas or lawsuits, the University may be required by law to provide electronic or other records, or information related to those records or relating to use of information resources, ("information records") to third parties. Additionally, the University may in its reasonable discretion review information records, e.g., for the proper functioning of the University, in connection with investigations or audits, or to protect the safety of individuals or the Stanford community. The University may also permit reasonable access to data to third-party service providers in order to provide, maintain or improve services to the University. Accordingly, users of University information resources do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when using the University's information resources.</p>

                   <p>The lead may designate another person to manage and operate the system, but responsibility for information resources remains with the lead. This designate is the "system administrator."</p> 
                   <p>The system administrator is responsible for managing and operating information resources under their oversight in compliance with University and department policies, including accessing information resources necessary to maintain operation of the systems under the care of the system administrator.

                   <p><strong>b. Accessing Information &amp; Systems</strong><br> Inspecting and monitoring information and information resources may be required for the purposes of enforcing this policy, conducting University investigations or audits, ensuring the safety of an individual or the University community, complying with law or ensuring proper operation of information resources. Only the University's Chief Information Security Officer (or designate) may authorize this inspection and monitoring.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Cooperation Expected</strong><br> Information resource users are expected to cooperate with any investigation of policy abuse. Failure to cooperate may be grounds for cancellation of access privileges, or other disciplinary actions.</p>

This policy refers to all University information resources whether individually-controlled or shared, stand-alone or networked. It applies to all computer and communication facilities owned, leased, operated, or contracted by the University. This includes networking devices, personal digital assistants, telephones, wireless devices, personal computers, workstations, mainframes, minicomputers, and any associated peripherals and software, regardless of whether used for administration, research, teaching or other purposes.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The purpose of information security is to protect the information resources of the University from unauthorized access or damage. The underlying principles followed to achieve that objective are:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Information Resource Availability</strong><br> The information resources of the University, including the network, the hardware, the software, the facilities, the infrastructure, and any other such resources, are available to support the teaching, learning, research, or administrative roles for which they are designated.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Information Integrity</strong><br> The information used in the pursuit of teaching, learning, research, or administration can be trusted to correctly reflect the reality it represents.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Information Confidentiality</strong><br> The ability to access or modify information is provided only to authorized users for authorized purposes.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Support of Academic Pursuits</strong><br> The requirement to safeguard information resources must be balanced with the need to support the pursuit of legitimate academic objectives.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Access to Information</strong><br> The value of information as an institutional resource increases through its appropriate use; its value diminishes through misuse, misinterpretation, or unnecessary restrictions to its access.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>All University information is classified into one of 4 levels based on sensitivity and risk. These classifications take into account legal protections, contractual agreements, ethical considerations, privacy issues, and strategic or proprietary worth. The classification level determines the security protections and access authorization mechanisms which must be used for the information. Security guidelines can be found in the <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/securitystandards">Stanford Minimum Security Guidelines</a>.&nbsp;The information classifications are as follows:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Prohibited Information</strong><br> Information is classified as "Prohibited" if protection of the information is required by law or government regulation, <strong><em>or</em></strong> Stanford is required either to provide notice to the individual if information is inappropriately accessed or to report unauthorized access to the government</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Restricted Information</strong><br> Information is classified as "Restricted" if (i) it would otherwise qualify as "Prohibited" but it has been determined by the <a href="http://dg.stanford.edu">Data Governance Board</a> that prohibiting information storage on Computing Equipment would significantly reduce faculty, staff, or student effectiveness when acting in support of Stanford's mission, or (ii) it is listed as <a href="http://securecomputing.stanford.edu/dataclass_chart.html">Restricted in the Classification of Common Data Elements</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Confidential Information</strong><br> Information is classified as "Confidential" if (i) it is not considered to be Prohibited or Restricted and is not generally available to the public, or (ii) it is listed as <a href="http://securecomputing.stanford.edu/dataclass_chart.html">Confidential in the Classification of Common Data Elements</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Public Information</strong><br> All information which does not fall into one of these categories is considered to be "public." Please see the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/dataclass_chart.html">Information Security Office</a>&nbsp;for a list of frequently used public information.</p>

                   <p>To ensure the security and integrity of both University data and data belonging to individuals, all owners of Stanford computer systems and networks must develop and implement access control policies. This Memo does not describe possible policies nor specify how to choose one; however, systems with non-public resources to protect should have policies that base access control on user identities.</p> 
                   <p>Authentication is the secure identification of system users. The system owner is responsible for determining which authentication method to use among those that may be available for a particular system. However, system owners are strongly encouraged to rely on the authentication services provided by Stanford's central computing organization rather than using system-specific authentication methods. This service provides secure authentication and consistent campus-wide identification.</p> 
                   <p>It is University policy that all University business for which computer-based forms and actions have been released will be done using those computer-based systems; paper forms are no longer accepted. This policy applies to all aspects of qualifying transactions, including initiation, routing, processing by Schools and VP Area offices, and transmission to and processing by central administrative offices. Secure identification of the participants in all such transactions is crucial to the successful conduct of University business. The centrally-supported authentication service described in this Memo is designed to support University business requirements.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Authentication Methods</strong><br> Authentication methods involve presenting both a public identifier (such as a user name or identification number) and private authentication information, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN), password, or information derived from a cryptographic key. Authentication methods currently supported by Stanford's central computing organization include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Kerberos authentication, which uses SUNet IDs and passwords.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility for Authentication Entry</strong><br> A user must be associated with an entry in the authentication service to be able to use most centrally-supported systems and services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) University ID and Regular Personal SUNet ID</strong><br> Eligibility for an entry in the authentication service begins when the individual accepts the offer of student registration or employment. Eligibility ends when a person's active association with the University ends; i.e., when an employee is no longer employed (and does not have emeritus status) or a student is no longer registered. In certain circumstances, a grace period may be allowed as a courtesy after eligibility ends. See University IT <a href="http://itservices.stanford.edu/service/accounts/closing-facstaff">procedures</a>.&nbsp;<br> <strong>(2) Sponsored SUNet ID</strong><br> A sponsored SUNet ID is sponsored for a specific period of time. The sponsor determines the length of sponsorship; sponsorship must be renewed to keep the ID valid. There is no grace period: the entry becomes invalid immediately at the end of the sponsorship period.<br> <strong>(3) Reactivation</strong><br> An entry may be reactivated if the individual subsequently rejoins the University, either via regular association or sponsorship.<br> <strong>(4) Suspension</strong><br> The use of an authentication entry may be revoked if it is used in a manner inconsistent with Stanford policies or if an individual is subject to other administrative action that denies them University privileges.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. User Responsibilities</strong><br> <strong>(1) Official Actions</strong><br> Use of the authentication service to identify oneself to an on-line system constitutes an official identification of the user to the University, in the same way that presenting an ID Card does. Users can be held responsible for all actions taken during authenticated sessions.<br> <strong>(2) Integrity</strong><br> Regardless of the authentication method used, users must use only the authentication information that they have been authorized to use; i.e., must never identify themselves falsely as another person or entity.<br> <strong>(3) Confidentiality</strong><br> Regardless of the authentication method used, users must keep their authentication information confidential; i.e., must not knowingly or negligently make it available for use by an unauthorized person.<br> <strong>(4) Reporting Problems</strong><br> Anyone suspecting that their authentication information has been compromised should contact the Information Security Office at <a href="mailto:security@stanford.edu">security@stanford.edu</a> or by entering a <a href="http://services.stanford.edu" target="_blank">help request </a>or by phoning the Stanford IT Service Desk at 650-725-4357.<br> <strong>(5) Security Precautions</strong><br> Users are strongly encouraged to change their password regularly (at least once every three months), to limit possible abuse of passwords that may have been compromised without the user's knowledge. Passwords should be chosen so that they are not easily guessable; e.g., not be based on the user's name or birth date.<br> <strong>(6) Disciplinary Action</strong><br> Individuals who are found to have knowingly violated one of these provisions will be subject to disciplinary action. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Kerberos, a sophisticated cryptographic authentication system, is the preferred authentication method for use with centrally-supported systems and services at Stanford.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Identifiers</strong><br> Stanford's Kerberos system uses personal SUNet IDs to name its entries for people. Other entities, such as network-based services, also have Kerberos entries.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Use</strong><br> Each Kerberos entry is associated with a srvtab or keytab based on a password hash maintained by the user. Kerberos software, installed on end-user computers, allows users to authenticate to network services using their SUNet ID and password.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Changing a Password</strong><br> Password changes may be made using standard Kerberos software or via <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/accounts/sunetids" target="_blank">University IT</a>. The Kerberos system checks proposed new passwords and rejects those that are likely to be easily guessable.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Reissuing Passwords</strong><br> When a SUNet ID holder forgets the password associated with a Kerberos entry, or if it is compromised and no longer private, he or she should immediately try to reset it themselves at <a href="https://accounts.stanford.edu/">https://accounts.stanford.edu/</a> or contact the Stanford IT Service Desk at (650) 725-4357 for assistance in having a new password issued.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The purpose of information security incident response is to:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a.</strong> mitigate the effects caused by such an incident,<br> <strong>b. </strong>protect the information resources of the University from future unauthorized access, use or damage, and<br> <strong>c.</strong> ensure that Stanford fulfills all of its obligations under University policy, and federal and state laws and regulations with respect to such incident.</p> 
                   <p>Stanford recognizes the need to follow established procedures to address situations that could indicate the security of the University's information assets may have been compromised. Such procedures include ensuring the appropriate level of University management becomes involved in the determination of actions implemented in response to an information technology security incident.</p> 
                   <p>A standard University-wide approach to information security is important in order to protect the security of Stanford's intellectual capital and to ensure that Information Security Incidents are handled properly, effectively and in a manner that minimizes the adverse impact to the University. Every user of any of Stanford's information resources has responsibility toward the protection of the University's information assets; certain offices and individuals have very specific responsibilities.</p>

                   <p>The specifications in this policy are independent of system architecture and delivery platforms—i.e., it makes no difference whether an application resides in mainframe, web, client/server, peer-to-peer, or other present or future environments. This policy applies to applications developed at Stanford, acquired from external vendors, built from open-source components, as well as those extended from existing or purchased applications, whether the systems are developed in central offices, in schools or in departments. This policy applies to all administrative applications that deal with financial, administrative, or other information that is an integral part of running the business of the University.</p> 
                   <p>The standards in this policy specifically apply to the Business Owner of any Administrative Computing System at Stanford University and to all persons who develop, implement, maintain or use any University Administrative Computing System.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>Administrative Computing System</strong><br> Any computing system that directly or indirectly deals with or supports financial, administrative, or other information that is an integral part of running the business of the University.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Business Owner</strong><br> The Business Owner of an Administrative Computing System is usually the owner of the primary business functions served by the system, the system's largest stakeholder. When the system serves several different functional business areas of the University, the Vice President of Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer will designate the Business Owner.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Data Owner</strong><br> The Dean, Director or Department Head of the administrative department having primary responsibility for creation and maintenance of the data content in an Administrative Computing System. In some cases, a single Administrative Computing System may have multiple Data Owners.</p> 
                   <p><strong>System Administrator</strong><br> Manages the day-to-day operation of the computer system(s) within an organization that supports the Administrative Computing System. These support functions may include any or all of the following functions: database management, software distribution and upgrading, user profile management, version control, backup &amp; recovery, system security and performance and capacity planning.</p> 
                   <p><strong>System Developer</strong><br> A person who designs and writes software. The term generally refers to designers and programmers in the commercial software field. However, it may also refer to professionals developing internal business applications within an enterprise. With increasing complexity of technology, and organizations' desire for complete solutions to information problems, requiring hardware, software and networking expertise in a multi-vendor environment, System Developers are integral to the implementation of Administrative Computing Systems.</p> 
                   <p><strong>System Integrator</strong><br> A person who takes responsibility for delivering a system solution which will solve a business problem. Systems Integrators are individuals or organizations that build systems from a variety of diverse components. With increasing complexity of technology, and organizations' desire for complete solutions to information problems, requiring hardware, software and networking expertise in a multi-vendor environment, Systems Integrators are often key in the implementation of Administrative Computing Systems.</p> 
                   <p><strong>System User</strong><br> Any individual who interacts with the computer at an application level. Programmers, System Administrators and other technical personnel are not considered System Users when working in a professional capacity on the Administrative Computer System.</p>

                   <p><strong>b. Procedures</strong><br> <strong>(1) When to inspect</strong><br> The frequency of inspections should be proportional to the magnitude of risk posed in the particular workplace. Inspections are also required whenever new substances, processes, procedures, or equipment presenting new, categorically different health and safety hazards are introduced into the workplace. The Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) will assist supervisors in inspectional responsibilities and will conduct independent inspections as necessary.<br> <strong>(2) Keeping Records</strong><br> Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that records of inspections are kept, including who conducted the inspections, dates, any unsafe conditions or practices found, and corrective actions taken. These records must be maintained for at least one year and available to EH&amp;S or to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on request. Self inspection checklists and guides and standard forms for inspection record-keeping may be obtained from EH&amp;S (723-0448).</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Payment for Services</strong><br> Medical examination expenses are charged to the employing department or project, unless previous arrangements have been made with The Stanford University Occupational Health Center (SUOHC). SUOHC will perform journal transfers for the costs of medical examinations of Stanford employees and prospective employees. All departments must arrange medical examinations with the SUOHC.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Making Appointments</strong><br> The department schedules the medical appointment with the SUOHC (650-725-5308). If an appointment cannot be kept, it is the responsibility of the department or individual to notify SUOHC and reschedule the appointment. If SUOHC is not notified at least 24 hours in advance, the department may be charged for the missed appointment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. New Employees</strong><br> Employees entering certain jobs, (e.g., respirator users, asbestos workers, police officers, hazardous materials emergency response team members, etc.) may be required to successfully complete a job-related physical examination before starting work. Employment in these positions is conditional upon satisfactory completion of the medical evaluation, and candidates for these positions should be so advised.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Record-keeping</strong><br> Currently, all records of medical examinations conducted under this policy are maintained at the SUOHC for the duration of an individual's participation in the Medical Surveillance Program and in accordance with State and Federal requirements.</p> 
                   <p>The examining clinician is expected to review the results of the examination with each program participant and provide appropriate referral(s) for abnormal findings.</p> 
                   <p>SUOHC will mail or email one copy of the medical clearance form to EH&amp;S. The clearance form outlines the participant's ability to perform a particular job, work in a potentially hazardous environment, and/or wear a respirator. SUOHC also sends a copy of the clearance form directly to the employing department/laboratory. If there are restrictions in an individual's ability to perform his/her job, the supervisor should contact EH&amp;S to determine the proper course of action. If necessary, Human Resources may be consulted.</p> 
                   <p>Each department with employees participating in the medical surveillance program must maintain a Medical Surveillance Program file which contains the clearance forms for all program participants. An additional copy is also kept at SUOHC.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Communication Services</strong><br> Information Technology Services/Shared Services has responsibility for the design, operation, and maintenance of telecommunication services for all Stanford University and Hospital facilities.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(1) Telephone System</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Shared Services operates the University-owned telephone system, providing service from the user's telephone jack (also called a telecommunication service outlet) up to the public network. Telephone services from any source, including SBC, are provided through the facilities of Shared Services.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(2) Network Systems</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Shared Services operates the University backbone network, providing access to the University network (SUNET) and off-campus network services. Shared Services may also provide facilities and installation for local departmental networks through the Net-to-Jack program.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(3) Scope of Service</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">The University telephone system and network operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing continuous service for the campus. Shared Services maintains these systems at the highest level of private branch exchange (PBX) service continuity. Departments that require total uninterrupted telephone or data communication services are responsible for working with Shared Services to plan, install, and maintain separate emergency backup services.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">(4) Consulting</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Shared Services provides consulting service to advise departments about the best use of telecommunication services and on-campus facilities, and to assist departments in ordering new services, changes to current configurations, or moves of existing service.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Departmental Responsibilities</strong><br> Deans, department heads, project directors, and other administrative officers are responsible for managing telephone expenditures (see <a href="/3-2-1">Guide Memo 3.2.1</a>: Authorizing Expenditures. Each department should appoint a responsible individual to act as a liaison with Shared Services. This person is the department's contact.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Contact Responsibilities</strong><br> The contact is responsible for:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Reviewing the monthly ITSS statement to validate all charges made to the department's accounts. Copies of the ITSS statement are sent online to the contact and may be reviewed online using the IT Services web site.</li> 
                    <li>Ordering new service or any service changes for the department. The contact should have signature authority for committing telecommunication expenditures for the department.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Support for Contact</strong><br> Shared Services maintains departmental assigned contacts online. These individuals receive regular information mailings from Shared Services and notification of potential outages affecting service to their department. Regular training is provided for individuals newly appointed to be the contact for their department. For information on contact training, or to notify Shared Services of a change in the named contact, call Shared Services at 5-HELP.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. System Equipment</strong><br> The telephone and network and associated peripheral equipment are maintained by Shared Services. All maintenance on the telephone line or switched data line is performed by Shared Services up to the end user's jack. Installation of new telephone or switched data lines as well as repairs or extensions to current lines may be performed only by Shared Services authorized personnel.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Departmental Equipment Ownership</strong><br> The end users' telecommunications equipment from the jack out is the responsibility of end users and their departments. This equipment includes line cords, telephone sets, modems, or other telecommunication terminals. This equipment is selected and owned by the end user's department. Shared Services recommends a number of telephones and other telecommunication terminals that work well in the University and Hospital environments. Uniformity in telephone equipment is desirable to provide the end user with ease of use from one telephone to another, quick access to services and easy training in equipment usage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Departmental Equipment Maintenance</strong><br> Shared Services provides:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Installation service for telephone sets</li> 
                    <li>End user training for the sets it recommends</li> 
                    <li>Maintenance for its supported telephone sets (on a cost recovery basis)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Departments may make arrangements to purchase telephone sets from Shared Services, or may purchase any compatible equipment from other sources. Each department is responsible for securing its own set maintenance, whether from Shared Services for its supported telephone sets, or from other sources.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Conduit and Cable Facilities</strong><br> The conduit and cable system for all telecommunications on the campus is managed by Shared Services. Shared Services maintains records of all telephone and other telecommunication services on the campus, including outside cable and conduit as well as in-building wiring up to the individual jack. Requests for the use of any of these facilities must be made through Shared Services and associated costs for installation, service activation, and continuing use paid by the requesting department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Building Wiring Facilities</strong><br> The University has adopted a standard for communications wiring to support current and future communication requirements within its buildings. (Refer to <a href="http://maps.stanford.edu/fdg_available#17">Facilities Design Guide Division 17–Communication Services.</a>&nbsp; All new and remodeled structures must use this standard as a minimum. Shared Services reviews all plans for communication wiring and must approve installation of wire (or other communication media) up to the jack. Departments may choose to install their own communication facilities within buildings, but such installation is incremental to the standard inside wiring managed by Shared Services. No department may use the University's inside wire plant without the consent of Shared Services, and payment of appropriate fees for maintaining records of this use, and for any installation or activation charges.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Intended Telephone Usage</strong><br> Business telephone facilities are provided for conducting the official business of the University. The system is designed for this purpose. All costs are charged to the department authorizing usage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Personal Telephone Usage</strong><br> Each department or organization should set guidelines as to personal telephone calls. The department must be reimbursed for the cost of all personal toll calls and long distance calls on the University's business telephone lines. Public telephones are generally available for personal calls.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Information About Phone Usage</strong><br> Any department may, through its appointed contact, request information about billable calls placed on its telephone lines. Information about these calls, including call destination, telephone line used, call duration, and authorization code used, is supplied only to the contact or to the department head. When a department suspects abuse of its telephone lines or authorization codes, it may request that information about such usage be supplied to appropriate Stanford disciplinary and review bodies and persons.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Call Tracing</strong><br> If a department receives threatening or abusive telephone calls, the contact for that department may request that Shared Services trace the source of incoming calls. Such a trace can provide information about calls placed from other campus telephones. Any trace is reported to the Stanford Public Safety Department and the information from a trace is provided only to the Public Safety Department. To request a trace of calls placed from off-campus requires a court order delivered to SBC, which must be arranged through the Stanford Public Safety Department.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Monitoring Call Activity</strong><br> If patterns of telephone usage on any line indicate the possibility of system abuse (such as multiple attempts to discover an active authorization code), Shared Services monitors and reports on the activity of that line, including call destination, in an attempt to discover the individual making such calls.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Recording Conversations</strong><br> Shared Services does not place a recording on any telephone line conversation, unless under court order. Any department that wishes to record telephone conversations must follow California State law relating to recording conversations.</p>

                   <ul> 
                    <li>Activation costs for the line</li>

Where line activity cannot be controlled, departments should select calling ability on the sets that will disallow billable calls.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Departmental Authorization Codes</strong><br> Authorization codes are randomly assigned numbers issued to individuals through their departments in order for departments to authorize long distance calls as well as track charges for billable calls. The department is liable for all charges for any calls placed using that code. The individual to whom the authorization code is issued is responsible for the confidentiality of that code and should not share the code with any other person, nor use the code to place unauthorized calls.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Departmental Calling Cards</strong><br> Calling cards from long-distance carriers are issued to individuals through their departments for placing calls when off the campus and charging them directly to the University. Calling cards are available from Shared Services, with all charges incurred from their usage billed to the requesting department on the monthly ITSS statement.</p> 
                   <p>The requesting department is liable for all charges for any calls placed using that calling card. The individual to whom the calling card is issued is responsible for the security of the card.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Departmental Data Lines</strong><br> The ordering department is responsible for all charges associated with the data line, including:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Activation costs for the line</li> 
                    <li>Monthly service charges for switched data lines</li> 
                    <li>Monthly maintenance charges for point-to-point circuits; or the department may elect to maintain these circuits itself</li> 
                    <li>Responsible care for any line driver equipment connected to the circuit that is provided to the department by Shared Services</li> 
                   </ul>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Telephone or Data lines</strong><br> <strong>(1) Communication Services Order Form</strong><br> Contacts may order new telephone or data lines, or changes to existing lines on the online Communication Service Order (CSO) form or using the IT Services web site.<br> <strong>(2) Consultation on Orders</strong><br> Shared Services provides consulting assistance in ordering new or changed service. Basic consulting is available 9:00 a.m.–noon and 1:00 p.m. –4:00 p.m. on workdays by calling 5-HELP. For large project moves, a communication system analyst is assigned to work with the contact to order service.<br> <strong>(3) Order Queries</strong><br> For update status on submitted CSOs, contact the Communication Services Order Processing Center at 5-HELP.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Authorization Codes and Calling Cards</strong><br> Contacts may request authorization codes and calling cards for individuals in the department. Contacts must request cancellation of codes and calling cards if the individual leaves the department.</p> 
                   <p>Requests for new codes or cards, cancellations, or account number changes for codes and cards should be made via the online CSO. For further assistance, call 5-HELP.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Billing</strong><br> All ITSS charges to departments appear on a monthly online statement. Contacts should review monthly ITSS statements to ensure that authorization codes are being used for approved calls and that all other charges are correct. Questions about items that appear on an ITSS statement should be directed to the Shared Services Account Center at 5-HELP. Resolution of billing disputes requires submission of an online HelpSU request no more than 21 days after the statement is available online.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Payment Policy</strong><br> Statement balances for students, on-site vendors, Stanford West, and General Accounts Receivable collections are due upon receipt; payments must be received by the 19th of the month in order to be reflected on the next month's statement. Non-payment of balances is treated as any other University debt and could result in:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Loss of service: </strong>Stanford can and will disconnect service when payment is more than 60 days late. Any past-due charges and fees must be paid in full before ITSS will reactive service; additional reactivation charges will also apply.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Hold placement:</strong> Stanford can and will withhold student registration privileges, diplomas, and transcripts for overdue accounts.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Collection actions: </strong>Stanford can and will initiate collection actions when payment is more than 60 days late for all except active students. This can adversely affect credit rating.</li> 
                    <li>Active students' unpaid balances will be assigned to a collection agency within 60 days after the student has left the University.</li> 
                    <li>Resolutions of billing disputes require submission of an online HelpSU request no more than 21 days after the statement with the disputed charges was mailed.</li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Incoming Mail</strong><br> <strong>(1) Campus Mail—</strong>U. S. Mail for campus departments is received and sorted at the U. S. Post Office, Palo Alto. Mail carriers deliver mail once a day to departmental building delivery points.<br> <strong>(2) Medical Center—</strong>U. S. Mail for the Hospital, patients, and the School of Medicine is received and sorted at Stanford Health Care mail services and delivered on the same schedule as Interdepartmental (ID) Mail (see 2.b(2)).<br> <strong>(3) SLAC—</strong>A U.S. Postal Service (USPS) carrier delivers mail to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) once a day.<br> <strong>(4) Post Office Boxes—</strong>Mailbox rentals at the Post Office are serviced Monday through Saturday.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Outgoing Mail<br> (1) Pickup Point—</strong>Carriers pick up mail at delivery points as a courtesy to customers. Because of limited capacity by the mail carrier, large outgoing mailings may not be picked up. U.S. Post Office mailboxes are provided throughout the campus for outgoing mail. Collection hours are posted on each box.<br> <strong>(2) Preparation of Materials—</strong>Departments can save on delivery time by separating stamped material from metered material and by further sorting the material into letters, big envelopes and packages. Metered mail must be bundled by separate classes of mail with all addresses facing the same way. Medical Center metered mail to be picked up by Stanford Health Care mail services must also have the mail metering reference number marked on the top piece of each bundle. For more information about mail metering reference numbers, contact Stanford Health Care mail services.<br> <strong>(3) Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods—</strong>Departments must not use U.S. Mail for shipment of biological or other hazardous materials, including dry ice. All shipments of hazardous materials/dangerous goods must be prepared and shipped only by trained and certified individuals. Additional information and assistance are at <a href="http://hazmatshipping.stanford.edu">http://hazmatshipping.stanford.edu</a>.<br> <strong>(4) Postal Information</strong>—Information about postage rates, classes of mail, and general regulations for domestic and foreign mail may be obtained at the Post Office and at <a href="https://www.usps.com/">https://www.usps.com/</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">c. Format for Stanford Addresses</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">A complete return address must be given for all correspondence. The electronic equipment for sorting mail scans the last two lines of the address. For fastest delivery, the preferred format for campus address information is:</span></p> 
                   <p>Line 1. Person's Name<br> Line 2. Stanford University<br> Line 3. Department, Building and Room Number<br> Line 4. Street Address<br> Line 5. Stanford, CA 94305-<em>nnnn</em> (Zip+4)</p> 
                   <p>Avoid putting "Stanford University" in the last two lines. If Stanford University appears in either of the last two lines, the mail is delivered in bulk to the Stanford Post Office, where it is sorted by hand. The USPS Zip Code+4 is <strong><u>not</u></strong> the same as the “ID” mail code. Use “StanfordWho” to look up correct information for individuals.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Misaddressed Mail</strong><br> Stanford Post Office carriers take undeliverable first-class mail with incorrect or insufficient addresses to the Information Section in the Registrar's Office, where efforts are made to locate the addresses. If located, the mail is forwarded in ID mail by Mail and Delivery Services (MDS). If not located, the mail is returned to the Post Office. Stanford Health Care mail services returns undeliverable mail to the Postal Carrier. Departments that receive mail for a person who has left should make a notation to that effect on the mail and return it to the sender.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. U.S. Mail Bulk Mailing<br> (1) Permit 28—</strong>To send bulk mail via USPS<strong>, </strong>it is economical to use the Stanford nonprofit mail Permit #28. Minimum requirements to qualify for nonprofit bulk mail postage rates are 500 pieces for First Class and 200 pieces or 50 pounds for Standard mail service. Contact an external mail preparation service to make arrangements for the mailing.&nbsp; The mail preparation service vendor will take care of the required USPS paperwork and obtain the necessary signature from MDS. The selected vendor must have an approved service request (see below<strong>*</strong>) for use of the permit. The department requesting the service pays the postage via the PTA provided to MDS. There is an additional processing fee charged for this service.</p> 
                   <p>*To utilize Permit #28<strong>,</strong> submit a Service Request:<br> 1) Go to <a href="https://bgm.stanford.edu/">https://bgm.stanford.edu/</a><br> 2) Select “Mailing Services”<br> 3) Select “Request for Mailing and Delivery Services”<br> 4) Follow instructions provided<br> 5) Give the generated request number to the appropriate mail preparation service vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Advance Planning—</strong>Departments are encouraged to call MDS for consultation early in the planning stages of a bulk mailing of U.S. Mail. Mailing requirements and cost estimates should be reviewed with MDS before the material is printed. Postal regulations and automation capabilities may affect the printing specifications and costs.<br> <strong>(3) Mail Preparation Services—</strong>Contact MDS for help in selecting a mailing preparation services vendor directly for mailing services such as folding, inserting, metering, etc. The department or the vendor should deliver the prepared materials respective postage statements to MDS for signature authorization before presenting the materials to the USPS for processing.<br> <strong>(4) Mailing Permit—</strong>Postal regulations require that the use of nonprofit postage permits must be reviewed and authorized by MDS.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Eligibility to Use Services</strong><br> ID Mail Services are provided primarily for conveyance of messages concerning the University's official business. ID mail may be used between the various University departments and administrative units. All organizations with responsibility to the University may use Campus ID mail services, including Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU).</p> 
                   <p>ID mail may be used to deliver general flyers concerning Stanford-related events or information.</p> 
                   <p>ID mail may not be used to distribute commercial or partisan political advertising.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Distribution of Interdepartmental Mail</strong><br> Three primary ID mail services are utilized at Stanford. Each mail room functions independently of each other.<br> <strong>(1) Campus Mail—</strong>Stanford ID Mail and Delivery Services (MDS) is located at 340 Bonair Siding, Stanford University.&nbsp; Campus ID mail services delivers mail to the Stanford campus Monday through Friday. Primary daily delivery is between the hours of 8 am-12 pm. Afternoon service is available at an additional cost. “Will call” requests can also be accommodated through MDS. &nbsp;All requests will be prioritized by the MDS Supervisor. &nbsp;All questions should be directed to the Campus Mail Room at (650) 723-2261 or <a href="mailto:mailcodes@lists.stanford.edu">mailcodes@lists.stanford.edu</a>.<br> <strong>(2) Medical Center Mail—</strong>All campus mail addressed to Medical Center departments is presorted by MDS. Mail is then picked up once a day by a courier from Stanford Health Care and re-sorted. Stanford Health Care mail services collects and delivers Campus ID mail at the Medical Center and Stanford Clinics twice a day. There is one delivery a day at the Hospital and the School of Medicine. Stanford Health Care mail services also delivers U.S. Mail. Mail for patients is delivered once a day. Medical inter-office mail is separate from Campus ID mail. All questions should be directed to the Medical Center Mail Room at (650) 723-5130.<br> <strong>(3) SLAC Mail—</strong>All mail that is addressed for delivery to SLAC is presorted at Campus MDS. At that point, mail is picked up once a day by a SLAC employee, re-sorted and delivered to SLAC departments. All questions should be directed to the SLAC Mail Room at (650) 926-2380.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Package Guidelines</strong><br> ALL mail rooms follow the same packaging guidelines. The maximum size limit for packages is 50 lbs. or 2 cubic feet. For larger pickups and deliveries, MDS services will accommodate most mailing needs if the respective mail room is contacted at least one day in advance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Inspection of Interdepartmental Mail</strong><br> <strong>(1) Regular ID Mail—</strong>The MDS supervisor may open ID mail for inspection when the addressee cannot be determined.<br> <strong>(2) Mail Marked "Confidential"—</strong>ID mail marked "Confidential" may be opened only by the person to whom the mail is addressed. In cases where neither the intended addressee nor a return address can be determined, the MDS supervisor is authorized to open the mail with the intent to locate information for proper delivery.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. ID Bulk Mailing</strong><br> Mailings of 50 pieces fall into the category of a "bulk mailing." Envelopes, flyers, postcards and pamphlets received in mail code order qualify for delivery service that is free of charge. Mailing that are not in mail code order will require a PTA number to cover service charges for sorting.<br> <strong>(1) Lead Time Required—</strong>Turnaround time is 5 working days for mailings received in mail code order and 7 working days when not in mail code order. Departments should consider these turnaround times when preparing time sensitive or dated material.<br> <strong>(2) ID Bulk Mail Preparation—</strong>To send bulk mail via ID mail, MDS can provide the most recent mailing code information for faculty and staff. The listing is updated each month. Departments should prepare bulk items and then request a mail code listing from&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mailcodes@lists.stanford.edu">mailcodes@lists.stanford.edu</a>. Arrange with an external mail preparation service to deliver the bulk mailing to the MDS loading dock at 340 Bonair Siding.<br> <br> <strong>f. Properly Addressing Interdepartmental Mail</strong><br> Address all mail completely and properly.<br> <strong>(1) Campus ID Mail: </strong>Include full name and mail code. Also include a return address.<br> <strong>(2) Medical Center: </strong>Full name, department, room number and mail code.<br> <strong>(3) SLAC: </strong>Full name and mail stop.</p> 
                   <p>The “ID” mail code is <strong><u>not</u></strong> the same as USPS Zip Code+4. Use “StanfordWho” to look up correct information.<br> <br> <strong>g. Department Moves</strong><br> When a department is planning a move, the appropriate mail room should be contacted at least two weeks in advance to provide the department’s previous address, new location and the date the move goes in to effect, as well as any other pertinent details.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Mail and Delivery Services, (650) 723-2261</li> 
                    <li>Medical Center Mail Room, (650) 723-5130</li> 
                    <li>SLAC Mail Room, (650) 926-2380</li> 
                    <li>Maps and Records, (650) 725-8472</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Newly organized departments (or departments relocating to another area) should contact MDS for changes and information on campus mail delivery and mail code assignment.&nbsp; A change in location might require a new mail code. Additionally, listings in “<a href="https://stanfordyou.stanford.edu">StanfordYou</a>” must be updated with the correct mail code to ensure proper delivery and to prevent delays.</p> 
                   <p>The department also needs to submit a Change of Address form to the Post Office. The Post Office might assign a new Zip+4 to the department. For questions regarding USPS Zip Code+4 codes and street addresses for newly activated buildings, contact Maps and Records. ID mail codes are NOT the same as USPS ZIP+4. If changes are anticipated, contact MDS.<br> <br> <strong>h. Individual Moves</strong><br> Change in work location for individuals should be entered by the department through PeopleSoft HRMS.<br> <br> <strong>I. Mailing List Corrections</strong><br> <strong>(1) MDS </strong>labels are generated from PeopleSoft HRMS and should be updated in “<a href="https://stanfordyou.stanford.edu">StanfordYou</a>” by the individual. MDS is not authorized to make these changes.<br> <strong>(2) </strong>To “opt out” of a particular mailing, please contact the originator of the mailing.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The use of mobile phones, tablets, and similar devices, and related communication services by Stanford employees in the course of their work is common. Stanford often provides these devices to employees to improve communication, productivity and work efficiency, to facilitate telecommuting and remote working, working between multiple campus locations and to otherwise enhance the contributions of employees. Stanford policies generally require University property to be used only for Stanford business use. However, this policy recognizes that a portion of the use of Equipment/Services may be for non-business use, such as personal phone calls or emails.</p> 
                   <p>As Internet service is a nearly ubiquitous household utility, similar to basic telephone service and electricity, the University generally does not provide reimbursement for home Internet connectivity. Employees who are required to have home Internet service to fulfill job requirements will be reimbursed for reasonable business use of their home internet service. Reimbursement of home internet expense, as described in this policy, must be approved by the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President, Dean, or his/her designee based on business necessity.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="stanford-business-use"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Stanford Business Use</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Stanford Business Use Required</strong><br> Stanford's resources are constrained by donor, sponsor and budgetary restrictions. Expenditures for Equipment/Services must follow a strict approval process, tied to demonstrated business need, rather than as compensation in the form of the latest technological gadget. Frequent turnover of such Equipment is discouraged. The employee's supervisor will determine and approve the Stanford business necessity for providing Equipment/ Services to the employee, based upon the employee's job duties, budget availability and local policy, custom and practice. Simple convenience is not a criterion for providing mobile equipment or reimbursing related services. The approval process will include a review of all aspects of the Equipment/Services ensuring that they are provided at a minimum cost to Stanford consistent with the Stanford business requirements of the employee.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Supervisory Approval</strong><br> The supervisor (or designee) must approve the provision of the Equipment/ Services, following their customary school, business unit or department (hereinafter each referred to as the "Department") practice for documentation of pre-approval of a business expense. Annual review of the necessity of Equipment/Services provided to a supervisor's staff is strongly encouraged.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Business Necessity</strong><br> Stanford business necessity occurs when one or more of these factors is present:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>It is vital for the mobile employee to be in constant touch with the office, lab or medical facility.</li> 
                    <li>The employee is responsible for emergency preparedness and must be available and on-call around-the-clock for a specific business period.</li> 
                    <li>A group of employees has the need for group or shared Equipment/Services such as rotating on-call contact.</li> 
                    <li>The employee does not have access to a landline or other communication device when doing a substantial portion of his or her job and communication with the supervisor or other Stanford business parties is required.</li> 
                    <li>The Equipment/Services eliminate or reduce the need for the employee to go back and forth between the Stanford Campus and one or more Stanford Alternative Worksite (as defined in <a href="/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-20">AGM 2.1.20.2.a</a>.), consistent with University goals to reduce traffic, benefit the environment and increase employee productivity.</li> 
                    <li>Provision of Equipment/Services is the most cost-effective way to meet the business communication requirements of the employee.</li> 
                    <li>The employee is a remote employee as defined by <a href="/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-21">AGM&nbsp;2.1.21</a>.</li> 
                    <li>Telecommuting, as defined in <a href="/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-20">AGM 2.1.20</a> does not constitute business necessity and is not a factor considered in determining whether business necessity exists.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Personal Use of Equipment and Services</strong><br> Provided that the Stanford business need for the service is significant and consistent over a substantial period of time, the personal use of Equipment/Services is not otherwise limited. However, the department and the employee's supervisor reserve the right to suspend provision of Equipment/Services in the case of excessive personal use.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Mobile Equipment and Service Selection</strong><br> The supervisor will determine the minimum cost Stanford IT service plan available, and the appropriate level of Equipment to be provided, considering the features needed for business use. When a Stanford IT cell/data and/or Stanford IT internet service plan is not appropriate, the department may provide a cell/data services stipend and/or home internet service stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of the employee-provided Equipment/Services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Use and Protection of University Provided Equipment and Services</strong><br> Equipment paid for by Stanford is the property of the Stanford department that paid for it. When an employee leaves Stanford or transfers from one department to another, Equipment furnished to the employee must be returned to the issuing department. It is expected that Equipment paid for by Stanford, where appropriate and feasible, will be in the possession of the employee at all times and be functional during the employee's business day. Employees must take all necessary measures to protect the Equipment from theft or damage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Laws and Policies Regulating Use of Equipment</strong><br> The employee will be solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and University policies relating to the use of Equipment/Services, including highway safety laws relating to cell phone and PDA usage, copyright laws, ergonomic use guidelines, privacy and security protocols and University export control and data security policies. See <a href="/6-3-1">Guide Memo 6.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Information Security.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Preference for Stanford IT-provided Equipment/Services</strong><br> It is the responsibility of employees and their supervisors to make sure that Equipment purchased is appropriate for the technical support capabilities of the School or Department. Stanford IT-provided Equipment/Services should be used in nearly every case. The accumulation of campus-wide purchases enhances the buying power of Stanford IT and generally provides the lowest prices possible. A large common pool of Equipment is also easier for the University to maintain and account for.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Further Requirements of Particular Schools and Departments</strong><br> Schools and Departments may establish local policies and procedures to further regulate or restrict the provision of Equipment/Services in their own units, if the University-wide policy is also followed.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Cell/Data Services</strong><br> If the supervisor has determined that the Stanford IT cell/data plan is not appropriate for the services required by an employee based on business necessity, the department may provide a stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of employee-provided mobile cell/data services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Administration of the Cell/Data Services Paycheck Stipend</strong><br> To receive a cell/data plan paycheck stipend, the Department HR Administrator may enter an employee cell phone supplement using the Supplemental Pay Webform with the Earnings Code of 'CEL'. The supplement may be entered to continue indefinitely, however, the business need for mobile Equipment/Services should be reviewed periodically by each employee's manager, or other financial staff in the business unit.</p> 
                   <p>A template request form that should be used is available at Stanford's <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/cell_usage_template_EE.doc" target="_blank">Gateway to Financial Activities</a>. Employees may be approved to receive a supplement of up to $25 monthly.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Internet Services</strong><br> If the supervisor has determined that business necessity exists for the employee to have home internet service, the department may provide a stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of home internet services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Administration of the Home Internet Equipment/Services Paycheck Stipend</strong><br> With approval from the responsible manager and local senior human resources manager, or each of their respective designees, an employee for whom business necessity for home Internet service is shown may be approved to receive a stipend for reimbursement of reasonable business use of home internet service. The supplement may be entered to continue indefinitely, however, the business need for home internet service should be reviewed periodically by each employee's manager, or other financial staff in the business unit.</p> 
                   <p>A template request form that should be used for documentation is available on Stanford's <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/home_internet_svcs_tmpl.doc">Gateway to Financial Activities</a>.

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Approval</strong><br> Policies concerning conferences are the responsibility of the offices of the President and Provost. The President has delegated approval for specific events as indicated in <a href="/8-2-1">Guide Memo 8.2.1</a>:&nbsp;University Events, and in the Public Events Policy and Practice Manual described in <a href="/8-2-1">Guide Memo 8.2.1</a>.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">For events involving minors, see also </span><a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-8/policy-1-8-1" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Guide Memo 1.8.1: Protection of Minors</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> and </span><a href="https://hr.stanford.edu/protection-minors" style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">the Protection of Minors website</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Relationship to University Program</strong><br> University facilities may be used for conferences that are closely related to the University program. The University officer approving the event (either the Conference Services Manager or the Director of Stanford Events, as described in <a href="/8-2-1">Guide Memo 8.2.1</a>) determines whether the event is related to the University program. Conferences may be arranged by schools, departments, and other University organizations. Outside academic organizations such as professional societies, faculty groups, and certain student groups may hold conferences at Stanford. Business and professional organizations may hold conferences at Stanford if their programs relate to the academic activities of the University. Conference participants usually must be affiliated with the sponsoring organization or be invited by the organization to register and attend.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Sponsorship</strong><br> Conferences must be sponsored by a school or department of the University. Outside organizations must obtain the sponsorship of an appropriate University dean or department head before requesting a conference.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Coordination Responsibility</strong><br> Coordination of conferences is divided between two offices, depending on the date of the event:<br> <strong>(1) Summer conferences </strong>(June 16 through September 14): Conference Office<br> <strong>(2) Academic year conferences</strong> (September 15 through June 15): Stanford Events</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Departmental Sponsor</strong><br> The dean or department head of the school or department sponsoring a conference designates a faculty or staff member to represent the school or department as sponsor of the event. The initiation of the conference proposal, and all transactions with the conference organizers concerning arrangements, fees and curriculum are handled through the individual designated as departmental sponsor.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Conference Request</strong><br> Sponsoring departments submit requests for approval through the office coordinating the conference (see 1.d above). A conference request should provide as much information as is known at the time the request is made, and should include the name of the sponsoring organization, its conference chair-person, proposed dates, length of the conference, estimated number of participants and, for summer conferences only, desired housing and food service.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Review Process</strong><br> The Manager of Conference Services or the Director of Stanford Events reviews requests for open dates and available facilities, as well as to determine that meetings are consistent with the University's fundamental mission of teaching, research and public service.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Notifications</strong><br> After a conference has been approved, the coordinating office notifies the department and sponsor and informs other University organizations as necessary.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Planning Session</strong><br> The coordinating office arranges a planning session with the department sponsor and the organization's conference chairperson. Specific arrangements for meeting rooms, equipment, housing, food and related services are discussed at this meeting.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Conference Accounting</strong><br> The sponsoring department identifies the need for opening any new accounts to record conference income and expense, and makes arrangements with the appropriate office to have these accounts set up.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of campus planning and transportation projects and programs for the improvement and general support of the University's academic community, hospitals, and its physical plant.&nbsp;Program funding is generated by an internal fee levied on monthly expenditures of all academic and hospital capital projects, as described below. The program facilitates the construction of bicycle and pedestrian paths, lighting, outdoor art, campus transit, roads and parking lot infrastructure, connective elements, and other site improvements that<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">&nbsp;directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service, and to promote conservation in land use and resources.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Assessment</strong><br> A 4.6% SIP assessment is&nbsp;applied on all expenditures (excluding fees for SIP, GUP Entitlement, Below Market Rate Housing (BMR), and the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD)) for capital projects&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">(including new buildings, renovations, deferred maintenance and the CUP), regardless of amount, funding or management.&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">For Stanford Health Care and Welch Road academic tenants in the City of Palo Alto, the SIP assessment is 2.3% on all expenditures (excluding fees for SIP, GUP Entitlement, Below Market Rate Housing (BMR), Palo Alto Union School District (PAUSD), computer hardware and software, medical equipment and furniture, and off-campus capital projects) for capital projects (including new buildings, renovations, deferred maintenance and CUP), regardless of amount, funding or management. The SIP percentage is lower for the aforementioned entities as they are required to provide and fund parking for their properties in the City of Palo Alto (i.e. SIP funds are unavailable in the City of Palo Alto).</span></p> 
                   <p>No assessments will be taken on SIP-funded or GUP Entitlement Fee funded projects, or software application programs.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><strong>b. Project Eligibility</strong><br> Any academic or auxiliary program may identify a need for a potential SIP project and seek SIP funding by submitting a project request to either the University Architect/Planning &amp; Design office (SIP-C) or the Stanford Transportation office (SIP-T) as appropriate. Each request must represent a project that will provide benefits to more than a single campus user, group, or building and each will be evaluated against the following general criteria:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Improves the overall quality of the campus environment</li> 
                    <li>Satisfies a particular academic or auxiliary program need</li> 
                    <li>Reduces total capital and operating budget expenses</li> 
                    <li>Fulfills a safety and/or security need</li> 
                    <li>Relates to and supports campus planning objectives</li> 
                    <li>Provides a renewal of a deteriorating infrastructure asset(s)</li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The GUP Entitlement Fee provides funding for the mitigation of projects and programs (Conditions of Approval) required by Santa Clara County as a result of the December 2000 Community Plan and GUP approval. The projects and programs required include infrastructure and environmental resource studies, a comprehensive water conservation program, transportation demand management, habitat conservation, and consultant monitoring of mitigation compliance. Additionally, GUP Entitlement Fees fund the cost of roadway expansions, new parking, and expanded childcare facilities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Assessment</strong><br> A GUP Entitlement Fee is assessed on increases in School/Department gross square footage on the main campus regardless of total project value. Housing units are required as a component of the GUP and are thus excluded from the GUP Entitlement Fee.</p> 
                   <p>The entitlement fee structure is based upon the present net value of projected mitigation costs, as described above. The fee will be set on a rolling three-year basis consistent with the Capital Plan and may be revised periodically. The forecasted rates for current and future GUP Entitlement Fees can be accessed on the <a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/finance/publications/capital-projectfees-table" target="_blank">Capital Projects Fees table</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Space Audit</strong><br> Although increases in School/Department square footage typically result from the construction of a new building, a variety of other factors may impact the square footage calculation to derive net incremental program growth. Any project that results in additional square footage will be subject to a space audit to determine the total amount of growth. The audit will consider a combination of space movements, including, but not limited to, space demolitions, vacated and reassigned space, and inherited space.</p> 
                   <p>All space changes are subject to the approval of the Provost.</p>

                   <p>All capital projects, regardless of total project budget, must have funding in hand or an approved backstopping plan prior to commencing construction.&nbsp;All capital project funding requests are initiated via the Form 1 process. Funding is transferred to an account established by the Controller’s Office. Form 1s may be approved by the Vice President of LBRE, or the Associate Vice President, Land and Buildings Academic Projects and Operations (up to a total project cost of $10 million). If the project was not approved in the Capital Plan and/or GUP square feet, central funding or centrally funded debt are requested, and were not previously allocated, the Form 1 must be routed to the Provost for approval.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Capital Projects under $25 million</strong></p> 
                   <ul>

                    <li>or will result in the change in use of an existing site must obtain several levels of approval from the Committee on Land and Buildings of the Board of Trustees.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>As documented in the <a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/dpm/what-we-do/project-delivery-process" target="_blank">Project Delivery Process</a>, a percentage of the total project budget is transferred to the account by the Controller’s Office at each Board-required approval.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Approval levels include Concept, Project, and Construction for building renovations; and Concept/Site, Design, and Construction for renovations, and Concept and Site, Design, and Construction for new buildings.

                   <p>Infrastructure programs with program funding identified (e.g., the CUP, SIP, GUP Entitlement Fee program) generally do not need separate funding plans and agreements; however, individual projects exceeding $25 million may require approval from the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p>The Funding Plan outlines the benchmarked project budget, the planned funding sources, and the estimated amounts from each funding source; addresses the budget responsibility for finance charges during construction, as well as debt servicing or gift backstopping provisions after construction completion; addresses restrictions on the use of tax-exempt debt;&nbsp;documents O&amp;M impacts and unit responsible, and&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">stipulates if a project is subject to a GUP Entitlement Fee.</span>&nbsp;Funding Plans are subject to revision if the project experiences significant changes in project scope or budget during the design phase.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>A University organization may acquire a new or used vehicle using any of the following methods:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Acquisition with University Funds</strong><br> Vehicles may be purchased or leased with regularly budgeted general funds, as with any purchase of capital equipment. If a purchase is financed, University policy requires that the purchase price be amortized over the useful life of the vehicle. See <a href="/5-2-1">Guide Memo 5.2.1</a>:&nbsp;Financing of Purchases.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Acquisition with Government Funds</strong><br> Vehicles may be acquired with funds provided by a U.S. government contract or grant if its terms permit. The procedures in Section 4 apply.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Acquisition by Gift</strong><br> Vehicles may be given to the University. The organization must record the donation in the Sunflower Assets System. See <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Acquisition through Surplus Property Sales</strong><br> Vehicles may be acquired through Surplus Property Sales using the procedures in Section 4.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Transfer</strong><br> Transfers within or between academic and administrative organizations are at the discretion of the organization(s) involved. They may also occur when one organization releases a vehicle to the Fleet Garage that meets another organization's needs (see Section 9.b.1).</p> 
                  </div>
                  <p class="back-to-top"><a href="#main-content">Back to top</a></p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="vehicle-acquisition-process"><span class="prefix-container">4. </span>Vehicle Acquisition Process</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Business Purpose for Vehicle</strong><br> Each vehicle acquired shall meet a valid University business purpose. Valid University business purpose for acquiring golf cart-type vehicles is limited to: 1) transporting personnel, equipment or supplies on campus for University purposes; 2) transporting employees or students with temporary or permanent disability-related needs; or 3) transporting members of the Stanford community using 5-SURE Security Escorts.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Replacement Schedule</strong><br> As a general guide, a vehicle should be considered for replacement on a seven-year or 60,000-mile basis, whichever comes first. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as defined by the California Health &amp; Safety Code, may be retained over a longer term.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Development of Specifications</strong><br> Each organization considering the acquisition of a vehicle must provide the valid business purpose for the vehicle to the Garage Supervisor. The Garage Supervisor provides mechanical specifications based on the business purpose and provides a cost estimate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Requisition</strong><br> To purchase or lease a vehicle not owned by the University, the requesting organization prepares an online requisition that includes the following approvers: 1) the Garage Supervisor; and 2) the appropriate dean, department head or other authorized signer. If the total cost of the vehicle exceeds $25,000, the requesting organization forwards the specifications and price estimates prepared by the Garage Supervisor to Purchasing, which issues a purchase order for the vehicle. See <a href="/5-3-1">Guide Memo 5.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Requisition Processing.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Suitability of Surplus Vehicles</strong><br> If an organization is contemplating acquiring a University vehicle from Surplus Property Sales, the organization should consult with the previous local fleet manager and the Garage Supervisor for information on the vehicle's condition, and should have the consent of the Garage Supervisor before acquiring the vehicle. If the vehicle is suitable for use, an interdepartmental transfer takes place. The acquiring organization compensates Surplus Property Sales for any expenses it has incurred.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Preference for Electric and Alternative-Fuel Vehicles</strong><br> The Fleet Garage recommends electric and alternative-fuel vehicles whenever possible. Before purchasing an electric vehicle, the organization should contact LBRE/Parking &amp; Transportation Services (PTS) and University Architect/Campus Planning &amp; Design (UA/CPD) to determine the location of the nearest charging station.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Reducing Number of Vehicles</strong><br> Organizations with multiple vehicles should explore the feasibility of placing them in an organization-wide motor pool to reduce their number of vehicles. Organizations with limited need for vehicles may establish an account with the car-sharing company on campus or may collaborate with neighboring organizations to establish regional motor pools. The Fleet Garage can assist with the establishment of motor pools.</p>

                   <p>Every vehicle acquired by any organization must be delivered to the Fleet Garage before the organization uses it.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Registration</strong><br> All street-legal vehicles, including street-legal golf cart-type vehicles, must be registered with the DMV. Vehicles are registered at the dealership in the name of The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University and using the address of the Fleet Garage. The Fleet Garage will assist in registering vehicles purchased outside of California. <em><strong>Exception: </strong></em>Vehicles purchased with government funds and for which the sponsor retains title are registered in the name of the government agency that supplied the funds, in care of the Board of Trustees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Inspection</strong><br> The Garage Supervisor inspects the vehicle to ensure specifications are met. If the vehicle is used, the Garage Supervisor determines whether it needs any immediate maintenance.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Inventory</strong><br> The Garage Supervisor assigns the vehicle a University fleet number and tags the vehicle with a Stanford University property tag. The Garage Supervisor enters the fleet number and property tag number into the LBRE maintenance management record-keeping system. When the organization receives the vehicle, it enters the fleet number and property tag number into the Sunflower Assets system. If the vehicle is transferred to another organization within the University, the fleet number and property tag number do not change. The organization receiving a transferred vehicle updates the numbers in the Sunflower Assets system. The numbers are retired when the vehicle is disposed of.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Sign</strong><br> The Garage Supervisor instructs the Sign Shop to apply a Stanford University logo and, where applicable, the name of the organization on the vehicle. This is the only sign permitted on the vehicle; others will be removed at the organization's expense. <strong><em>Exceptions:</em></strong> Specialized markings are permitted on Marguerite shuttles and Department of Public Safety vehicles. The Garage Supervisor may authorize additional exceptions.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Role of Fleet Garage</strong><br> The Fleet Garage performs or approves all maintenance and repairs for University vehicles that are regularly housed within 15 miles of campus. The organization must get written approval in advance from the Fleet Garage to use another service provider. When approved to use another service provider, the organization must ensure the maintenance is performed in a timely manner and provide the Fleet Garage with written records of the maintenance within one week of its completion. The Fleet Garage provides maintenance guidelines for vehicles serviced off campus, including all vehicles housed more than 15 miles from campus.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Preventive Maintenance</strong><br> Organizations must ensure that internal combustion vehicles receive preventive maintenance inspections every four months. Organizations must make electric vehicles available in the field for monthly inspections and ensure that they receive annual preventive maintenance inspections at the Fleet Garage. The Fleet Garage notifies the organization of required periodic preventive maintenance appointments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Other Maintenance</strong><br> The organization must keep its vehicles clean. Body damage must be repaired promptly by making arrangements with the Fleet Garage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Disabled Vehicles</strong><br> If a vehicle becomes disabled, the organization must notify the Fleet Garage immediately.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Recalls</strong><br> The Fleet Garage receives manufacturers' recall notices and notifies the organization of recalls. The organization must make arrangements with the Fleet Garage to have recalls addressed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Consequences of Failure to Maintain</strong><br> If the organization fails to have maintenance or repairs performed on a vehicle after a second notice from the Fleet Garage, the Fleet Garage may retrieve the vehicle from the organization to perform the maintenance or repairs.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Disposition Process</strong><br> An organization disposing of a vehicle must process an Excess Request in the Sunflower Assets System and deliver the vehicle to the Fleet Garage. PMO processes the Excess Request and the Fleet Garage updates the LBRE maintenance management record-keeping system according to the ultimate disposition method for the vehicle.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Disposition Methods</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>1) Transfer Within the University</strong><br> If the vehicle is roadworthy and is expected to have sufficient useful life remaining to benefit another organization, the Garage Supervisor examines vehicle acquisition requests to see if the vehicle meets another organization's needs. If the Garage Supervisor is able to arrange a transfer of the vehicle, he or she notifies PMO, which ensures that the appropriate Department Property Administrator(s) are notified and the property records updated. PMO also terminates the Excess Request. If the vehicle is leased, the organization must notify the Department of Capital Accounting in the Controller's Office, which ensures that the remaining lease payments are properly charged.</p> 
                   <p><strong>2) Disposition Through Surplus Property Sales</strong><br> If the vehicle is roadworthy and is not being transferred within the University, the Fleet Garage retires the vehicle from the University fleet, sends it to Surplus Property Sales to be sold and, upon sale, notifies DMV. The portion of the proceeds representing return of capital is credited to the University account that financed the purchase. Any gain realized by the organization from the sale is credited to the account used in the acquisition of the replacement vehicle, or to the general organization operating account if the vehicle is not replaced.</p> 
                   <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">If an organization acquires a vehicle from Surplus Property Sales, the vehicle is returned to the Fleet Garage to have a University logo and the old fleet number reaffixed. The original property tag remains intact.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">3) Scrap</strong><br> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">If the vehicle is not roadworthy, the Fleet Garage arranges for it to be scrapped, forwards the appropriate junk slips to DMV and notifies PMO to ensure proper record retirements can take place.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Special Cases</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>1) Government-owned Vehicles</strong><br> If title to the vehicle is held by a government agency in care of the Board of Trustees, the organization must contact PMO for information on disposal options. See<a href="/5-2-4"> Guide Memo 5.2.4</a>:&nbsp;Surplus Property Sales.</p> 
                   <p><strong>2) Donated Vehicles</strong><br> If the vehicle was donated to the University, the organization must contact PMO for information on disposal options. See <a href="/4-2-3">Guide Memo 4.2.3</a>:&nbsp;Records of Donated Equipment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>3) Leased Vehicles</strong><br> Unless a leased vehicle is being transferred within the University, the Fleet Garage returns the vehicle to the lessor and notifies PMO to have the records retired. The organization must satisfy the lease contract terms, including all remaining payments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>4) Vehicles with Active Loans</strong><br> If the vehicle is under the terms of a University financial loan, the organization must notify the Department of Capital Accounting in the Controller's Office of the disposition. The Department of Capital Accounting ensures that the remaining loan payments are properly charged.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. University Vehicles</strong><br> Stanford's liability insurance program provides protection to authorized drivers of University vehicles. Stanford self-insures for collision, fire, theft and liability. When an accident is due to an authorized driver's negligence, the organization usually pays the first $1,000 in vehicle repair costs. See <a href="https://orm.stanford.edu/vehicle-use-and-accident-reporting">Guidelines for University Vehicles, Rentals, Accident Reporting and Personal Vehicles</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Personal Vehicles<br> (1) Required Insurance</strong><br> Individuals who drive personal vehicles more than 20 hours per month in connection with official University activities must have the following minimum insurance coverage: bodily injury coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident and $100,000 for property damage, or $300,000 combined single limit. (<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> These minimum insurance coverages are strongly recommended for individuals who drive personal vehicles in connection with official University activities less than 20 hours per month.) Any other individual driving a personal vehicle in connection with official University activities must have the minimum insurance coverage required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is registered. Proof of insurance must be provided upon request.<br> <strong>(2) Excess Liability Coverage</strong><br> If an authorized driver has the minimum insurance required in Section 7.b.1, Stanford's liability insurance policy program may provide excess liability insurance protection to the driver while he/she is using a personal vehicle in connection with official University activities. The driver's insurance is primary and must be used before the University's insurance program will defend or pay any claim.<br> <strong>(3) Coverage Limitations</strong><br> Stanford does not provide any insurance protection for fire, theft, collision or other loss or damage to personal vehicles. Individuals who use their vehicles frequently in connection with official University activities should consult with their insurance agent or broker to make sure their insurance meets their needs. The organization will pay the deductible for damage to a personal vehicle used in connection with official University activities, up to $1,000.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Rented Vehicles</strong><br> For rented vehicles, including vehicles rented from a car-sharing service for local use, drivers must obtain or decline the rental car company's additional insurance according to the requirements of <a href="/5-4-2">Guide Memo 5.4.2</a>: Business and Travel Expenses. The rental agency's insurance, if obtained, must first be used before Stanford's insurance becomes applicable. Organizations are not required to pay any costs for loss or damage to rented vehicles or for liability.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Business Travel Accident Insurance</strong><br> If an employee is engaged in the performance of authorized travel for the University and the accident results in the employee's death, dismemberment or permanent total disability, the University's business travel accident insurance may apply. (See <a href="/2-3-1">Guide Memo 2.3.1</a>:&nbsp;Survivor Benefit Plans.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Student Hourly Employment</strong><br> Stanford University uses student hourly employment to hire Stanford students for jobs that are specifically earmarked for matriculated students. All Stanford University student employment is hourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are limited to graduate students (see <a href="/10-2-1">Guide Memo 10.2.1</a>). Student workers are supervised in their work, are hired through the PeopleSoft HR system, and must record and approve their work hours. Compensation for all undergraduate student jobs must be established on an hourly basis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of hours worked in each pay period. These job assignments are incidental to the student’s course of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic quarter on the nature of the work assignment and the number of hours of employment. Students cannot volunteer for positions that are normally paid positions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Stipend</strong><br> A token payment to recognize a student for a one-time event or support for a project such as an undergraduate research project. Stipends are not used as compensation for employment. All undergraduate stipend payments are processed by the <a href="http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html" target="_blank">Financial Aid Office</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Student Residence Roles</strong><br> Each residence on campus has a core group of students that charges itself with managing the various programmatic components of life in the residences. A nominal stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction with many of these roles (<a href="https://resed.stanford.edu/get-involved">https://resed.stanford.edu/get-involved</a>).</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Contingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment</strong> is used to hire an individual for a part-time or temporary staff position. Contingent employment must be used for hourly employment assignments for non-matriculated students or matriculated students when on a Leave of Absence. Contingent employment is not normally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students but must be used for any student working more than 36 hours per week.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Federal Work-Study (FWS)</strong><br> Stanford University participates in the FWS program as defined in Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Under this program funds are allocated to Stanford to allow students with qualifying financial need to gain valuable work experience while earning money to help pay for college. The program is administered by the Financial Aid Office in coordination with the hiring departments. Under the FWS program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of student wages, and the Provost pays the remaining 25%. A subset of the FWS program, Community Service Work-Study, allows qualifying students to work off campus at nonprofits who take responsibility for 10% of student wages (<a href="http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html" target="_blank">more information</a>).</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Off-Campus Internships and Off-Campus Employment</strong> are not covered by this policy, with the exception of federal Community Service Work-Study positions managed by the Haas Center for Public Service. In both cases, students are encouraged to be mindful that their primary obligation is to their academic program.&nbsp; International students must also adhere to visa requirements.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Job Listing Services</strong><br> Stanford departments wishing to hire undergraduate students as part-time workers are strongly encouraged to use the Handshake system administered by BEAM, Stanford Career Education to list their job openings. Departments should log onto <a href="https://stanford.joinhandshake.com/login">https://stanford.joinhandshake.com/login</a> to post a job and reach a large cross section of students.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Hours Per Week</strong><br> Students are encouraged to limit their hours of work so that they may devote sufficient attention to their studies. Therefore, the jobs listed for undergraduates during any enrollment period should not typically require more than 15 hours per week of work. During break periods between quarters, undergraduates may be employed full time. Thanksgiving recess is not a break between quarters.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. International students</strong> on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both University policies on employment and visa requirements that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Students on Financial Aid</strong><br> Nearly half of Stanford’s undergraduate population receives need-based aid and most are expected to contribute toward their costs through employment. The standard expectation can be met by working eight to ten hours per week. Not all students receiving aid will qualify for Federal Work-Study; when possible, department funded jobs should be made available for students on aid.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Non-Discrimination</strong><br> Non-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in <a href="/2-1-2">Guide Memo 2.1.2</a>, section 2.a, and also apply to student employees.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>The following schedule is is designed to promote consistency in student pay. Starting wages in these categories are based on the requirements of the job and the applicable experience of the student. Range within levels is available to allow employers' flexibility in setting student wage rates as job requirements and student performance vary widely. The suggested wage scale is updated annually at <a href="http://financialaid.stanford.edu/aid/employ/wage_scale.html">http://financialaid.stanford.edu/aid/employ/wage_scale</a>.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Level I</strong><br> The work at this level requires that employees perform tasks characterized by a prescribed standard. Duties typically are repetitive and workers follow simple instructions that require little interpretation or skill. The supervisor determines work priorities and reviews work for accuracy. Typical kinds of work at this level include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Office work requiring minimum skills, such as file clerk, messenger, or receptionist</li> 
                    <li>Light manual labor such as animal caretaker, driver, or tour guide</li> 
                    <li>Rudimentary laboratory work such as glassware washer</li> 
                    <li>Food service work in the residences</li> 
                    <li>Library work such as shelving, checking in materials, completing forms, photocopying, or preparing materials for binding</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Level II</strong><br> At this level, employees have independent responsibility for the accurate completion of a variety of tasks requiring judgment and interpretation in applying procedures correctly. The supervisor generally reviews the work for correct final results. Typical kinds of work at this level include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Office work requiring basic accounting, or knowledge of office machines</li> 
                    <li>Strenuous labor such as gardener or storekeeper</li> 
                    <li>Technical work requiring specialized skills such as photographer, or projectionist</li> 
                    <li>Laboratory work requiring a moderate level of scientific knowledge</li> 
                    <li>Library work such as answering information questions, basic use of claims and invoices, or nonroutine clerical duties</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Level III</strong><br> At this level, employees have substantial responsibility for determining work procedures and methods of work and for coordinating phases of work with others. Originality, analysis, and judgment are required to carry out work. The supervisor reviews work when guidance is required. Typical kinds of work include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Computer programmer</li> 
                    <li>Administrative assistant</li> 
                    <li>Musician, or artist</li> 
                    <li>Job recruiter</li> 
                    <li>Library work that requires extensive use of foreign languages, having responsibility for a branch library or similar unit for long periods of time without supervision, or very specialized bibliographic searching including in-depth use of RLIN</li> 
                   </ul>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="hiring,-paying,-and-supervising-students"><span class="prefix-container">4. </span>Hiring, Paying, and Supervising Students</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Hiring</strong><br> The supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry. Students should be hired into the appropriate <a href="https://stanford.box.com/s/c7xhv14taumczjyydkhg24bmz6bfjcud" target="_blank">Job Classification Code (JCC)</a>. The student must be hired into PeopleSoft HR before beginning work. Students who are hired during summer quarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as Student Hourly Employees using the appropriate Summer Student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work assignment that started during the academic year.&nbsp; Procedures for hiring FWS students can be found at <a href="http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html" target="_blank">http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergraduate</a>.</p> 
                   <p>Students who receive a university award that includes funding to hire undergraduate students to complete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other&nbsp;effort associated with academic projects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding and hire the student hourly&nbsp;employee.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Payment</strong><br> Departments pay student workers from their own sources of funding, except for students who qualify for FWS. Hourly student workers must record actual hours worked in Axess Timecard each pay period. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Supervision</strong><br> One person should be named as the student's immediate supervisor and should be directly accountable for overseeing the student's work and ensuring approval of hours worked in Axess.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Work Schedules</strong><br> A student is expected to work the agreed hours, be punctual and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus employers build in some flexibility in hours given students' exam schedules, but that is not always possible and students are expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. <strong>Sick Time</strong></strong><br> Sick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons. All Stanford student hourly employees receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours. For information about the accrual and use of sick time for student hourly employees, see <a href="/chapter-10/subchapter-3/policy-10-3-1">Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1</a>.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Graduate Student Assistantships</strong> are a form of student employment, earning a compensation package including both salary and tuition allowance (TAL) for the performance of research or teaching services to the University as part of the student's academic and professional training and development.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Distinctions from Assistantships:</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Fellowships</strong><br> Fellowship stipends are financial aid, not salary. No service is expected in return for a fellowship; it is awarded on a merit basis to assist a student in the pursuit of a degree.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Hourly Employment through Payroll</strong><br> Graduate students may be employed and paid for work unrelated to the student's academic and professional training as described in <a href="/chapter-10/subchapter-2/policy-10-2-2" target="_blank">Administrative Guide 10.2.2</a>: Graduate Student Hourly Employment. Such employment is not considered an assistantship appointment, does not generate tuition, and is not processed in GFS.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. The Graduate Financial Support (GFS) system</strong> is the online application used to enter all graduate student research and teaching assistantship appointments and fellowships. Although they are not matriculated Stanford graduate students, Postdoctoral Scholars' appointments also are entered in GFS. GFS also handles financial support for other non-matriculated graduate students, e.g., Visiting Student Researchers. Non-matriculated students are, however, in general not eligible for assistantships.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="assistantship-eligibility-criteria"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Assistantship Eligibility Criteria</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Matriculation at Stanford</strong> with an active authorization to enroll and an active graduate degree program, or, for Research Assistantships only, enrollment in non-matriculated graduate status as a Student of New Faculty. Coterminal students in both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree program are eligible for assistantships after completion of 12 quarters or, upon request, after completion of 180 units of undergraduate work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Enrollment</strong><br> All students holding assistantships <strong>must be enrolled in each quarter</strong> in which the assistantship appointment is held. For autumn, winter and spring quarters, unless the student is on TGR status, the student must be enrolled for 8-9-10 units. Except for Terminal Graduate Registration (TGR) students, the GFS System will not allow payment of TAL unless the graduate student is enrolled full-time during autumn, winter and spring quarters. Exceptions to this enrollment requirement are allowed for Honor Co-op students, for students with disabilities, and for a childbirth accommodation.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Relevancy</strong><br> The service performed (teaching or research) must be related to the student's academic program in order to qualify for the assistantship appointment.</p> 
                   <p><em>Note:</em> Entering and approving the assistantship appointment in Graduate Financial Support (GFS)/Worklist Manager constitutes a statement that the work involved is relevant to the student's academic program.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. English proficiency for teaching assistantships</strong><br> All international students must be approved for English proficiency before being appointed to any teaching position.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The department that plans to appoint an international student as a TA/CA must have the student review the <a href="https://language.stanford.edu/programs/efs/languages/english-foreign-students/international-teachingcourse-assistant-screening" target="_blank">TA screening webpage</a>, that has information about making an appointment. <em>Note</em>: Whenever possible, the TA screening should occur at least one full quarter in advance of the assistantship appointment. This allows the student time to take any required or recommended classes to improved communication skills.</li> 
                    <li>Upon successful completion of the TA screen and/or required classes, EFS enters the approval of English proficiency (TA OK) in the GFS system, after which the assistantship appointment can be processed.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>e. I-9 eligibility to work in the U.S.A.</strong><br> By federal regulation, all individuals receiving salary through Payroll must demonstrate eligibility to work in the U.S.A. by filing Federal Form I-9. Departments must forward necessary paperwork to Payroll in advance of the student's first paycheck. For more information, see <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/payadmin_student.html">Student Specific Payroll Administration</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Social Security Number</strong> must be on file with Payroll.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Alternatives</strong><br> In the case where no matriculated graduate student is available to fill a need for a Research or Teaching Assistantship, an undergraduate or non-matriculated person may be hired in the categories of Teaching Aide or Research Aide. These are hourly-paid positions, processed through the Human Resources Management System (HRMS), not the GFS system. Individuals appointed to these positions are never eligible for a Tuition Allowance. The appropriate department chair (or program director) and school dean's office should confirm that no matriculated graduate student is available before these alternative appointments are processed.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="types-of-assistantship-appointments:-teaching"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Types of Assistantship Appointments: Teaching</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Graduate student teaching responsibilities are categorized into the following four appointment levels.</p> 
                   <p>Stanford University establishes annually a minimum salary rate for each of these levels. (Mentor Teaching Affiliate and Graduate Teaching Affiliate positions have the same minimum salary.)</p> 
                   <p><em>Note: </em>No student may be appointed to any of the following positions for a course in which the student is simultaneously enrolled.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Course Assistant</strong><br> Assists a faculty member who has primary responsibility for a course. Duties vary but do not include classroom teaching. Duties may include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Assisting in the preparation of lecture materials and running laboratory sessions.</li> 
                    <li>Conducting review sessions and grading exams.</li> 
                    <li>Holding office hours.</li> 
                    <li>Monitoring or maintaining existing course web sites.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Teaching Assistant</strong><br> Has significantly more independence than a Course Assistant. The Teaching Assistant works with a faculty member who has primary responsibility for a course, or assists a group of students in several courses. Duties vary and may include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Preparing for class sections and/or laboratories where new material may be presented.</li> 
                    <li>Presenting material in classroom or lab setting.</li> 
                    <li>Marking and/or grading some portion or all of the exams or papers (but not independently assigning the final grade).</li> 
                    <li>Holding regular office hours.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Graduate Teaching Affiliate</strong><br> This teaching appointment is limited to graduate students who have had substantial teaching experience. The Graduate Teaching Affiliate will typically be identified as the Instructor in Stanford publications, and will have primary charge and responsibility for the course (with the mentorship of a faculty member). Responsibilities for the class typically include:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Preparation, teaching, grading, holding regular office hours, etc., in keeping with the established practices of the department.</li> 
                    <li>In some cases Graduate Teaching Affiliates have full responsibility for a course where the content is defined by a faculty coordinator. In other cases, they will develop course materials independently with the guidance of a faculty mentor for a course that has been approved by the department/program in which it is offered.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Mentor Teaching Assistant</strong><br> This teaching appointment is limited to graduate students who have had substantial teaching experience. In addition to the responsibilities of a Teaching Assistant, this student:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Serves as a head Teaching Assistant to coordinate the training and guidance of Teaching Assistants in a given course or set of courses.</li> 
                    <li>Develops complex materials (including web-based) in support of a course or group of courses.</li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Full-quarter Appointments</strong><br> Assistantship appointments are made for a full quarter (3 months of either teaching or research work). Standard appointment periods are: October 1–December 31, January 1–March 31, April 1–June 30, and July 1–September 30. An alternate quarter schedule is available for students whose work begins before the start of a standard quarter. Students on an alternate schedule must remain on that schedule throughout the academic year.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Autumn, Winter and Spring Assistantship Appointments</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) </strong>The minimum assistantship is 10% time. Percentage of appointments must be in increments of 5% time.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) 50% Maximum</strong> — The typical assistantship appointment is for a maximum of 50% time, to allow students to make expeditious progress toward their degree. Assistantships totaling more than 50% can impede that progress.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3)</strong> An appointment of 40% may be combined with a 10% appointment to total 50%. Appointments of 45% are not allowed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Approval for Exceptions </strong>— Assistantships for more than 50% time during the academic year, two concurrent assistantships totaling more than 50% time, or enrollment in more than 10 units while holding a 50% appointment, require the prior approval of the student's advisor, the Department Chair, and School Dean's office.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Recommendations for such assistantship appointments should indicate the academic progress of the student and the anticipated degree completion date; the student must have been admitted to candidacy.</li> 
                    <li>Approval will be granted only where such an assistantship appointment will not interfere with progress towards the degree and normally will be granted for no more than one year.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Summer Assistantship Appointments</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Percentage of Time</strong>—In summer quarter, in addition to the standard 10-50% assistantships, appointments at 60-90% time are permitted (see section 5.d).</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Number of Units</strong>—In summer quarter, graduate students must be enrolled in at least one unit or TGR (Terminal Graduate Registration) to have any size assistantship appointment. Students with appointments totaling more than 50% will have their Tuition Allowance reduced proportionately (see <a href="http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables">TAL tables</a>) in order to accommodate additional employment. (For example: A student's 70% appointment(s) earns the same TAL as a 30% appointment. Appointments of 90% provide TAL equal to the value of 1-3 units of tuition.) Students combining an assistantship with more than 8 hours of hourly employment during the summer should reduce their enrollment in proportion to their total Summer Quarter employment. Students registered TGR must enroll in the TGR course (801 or 802).</p> 
                   <p>For additional information regarding TAL in Summer, see Section 7.d(4).</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Assistantships Totaling More Than 50%</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) </strong>Whether approved as an exception (5.b.4 above) or permitted as summer employment, the maximum combined assistantships for any student during any quarter is 90%. Appointments totaling more than 36 hours/week may not be processed in GFS, are not considered assistantships, and do not include a tuition allowance; they should instead be processed through HRMS.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) </strong>Whenever possible, graduate student assistantship appointments totaling more than 50% should be established as a single appointment, rather than a combination of smaller appointments. (This allows GFS to calculate the appropriate TAL; if entered separately, administrators must determine the appropriate TAL cost and split, and coordinate adjustments to GFS.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Shortened Summer Assistantships</strong><br> During Summer quarter, when many courses are shorter and the&nbsp;between-quarters period is longer than in Autumn/Winter/Spring quarters, a teaching or research assistantship may be offered for less than the full&nbsp;three-month period, but must be at least two months in duration. Summer&nbsp;assistantships must begin on the quarterly start-date (July 1,&nbsp;unless the student is on the alternate calendar), but the end date may be set at two months or later,&nbsp;rather than the full 3-month period. This should be done only in the&nbsp;Summer&nbsp;Quarter, and only where the research or teaching effort is significantly less than expected in a normal quarter-long appointment. In these cases, the student will&nbsp;earn the full tuition allowance and a specific&nbsp;salary per pay period (often, the department's standard semi-monthly salary). The student should be advised that the shorter work period will generate less total salary.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Definition</strong><br> TAL represents a commitment to support a student's educational program through the payment of a portion of the student's tuition bill.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Eligibility</strong><br> All eligibility requirements for assistantship appointments must be met. (See section 2.)</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Source of Funding</strong><br> The value of TAL for a 50% assistantship appointment is established as the tuition value for 8-10 units (8-9 units in the Law School, and 8 units in the MED MD program). The value of TAL for assistantship appointments of between 10% and 50% is a proportional amount defined by <a href="http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables">TAL Tables</a> published each year.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Tuition charges and TAL are based on the student's home school tuition rate, regardless of the location of the assistantship. The school/department where the student holds the assistantship appointment is responsible for the salary, as well as the tuition based on the student's home school tuition rate.</p> 
                   <p>The University requires that any outside tuition support to which students have access will be used to the full extent before TAL is claimed. Acceptance of a Stanford assistantship appointment obliges a student to inform the department of any other aid received.</p> 
                   <p>The cost of the TAL is shared among Stanford University funds and school, department, and/or sponsored project funds supporting the assistantship.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) TAL Funding for Research Assistants</strong><br> TAL for Research Assistants is divided and funded as follows:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Sponsored portion: Except for the School of Medicine, 60% of the TAL amount is charged directly to the sponsored project or other source of funds supporting the assistantship; in the School of Medicine, 81% of the TAL amount is directly charged.</li> 
                    <li>Stanford portion: 40% of the TAL amount is paid by Stanford University, or by the school in which the assistant is working; the School of Medicine pays 19% of the TAL amount. Except in the Schools of Business and Medicine, University general funds are used to pay the Stanford portion of TAL for Research Assistants. The Schools of Business and Medicine cover the Stanford portion of TAL for Research Assistants from their own funds.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) TAL Funding for Teaching Assistants</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In all schools other than Schools of Business and Medicine, TAL for Teaching Assistants is funded by a University budget allocation to the schools/departments. Schools, departments or programs may also fund additional TAL for Teaching Assistants, beyond the University budget allocation.</li> 
                    <li>The Schools of Business and Medicine are responsible for covering the cost of TAL for Teaching Assistants working in their schools.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Federal Work Study (FWS)</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>FWS funds cannot be used to pay TAL.</li> 
                    <li>If a student has a research assistantship funded by FWS, the FWS funds pay the student's salary, the school/department pays the "sponsored portion," i.e., 60%, of the tuition, and the University pays the difference, i.e., 40%, from general funds.</li> 
                    <li>If a student has a teaching assistantship funded by FWS, the FWS funds pay the student's salary. TAL funding for these students is as described in Section 7.c (2) above.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(4) TAL Funding for Military Personnel</strong></p> 
                   <p>Stanford Principal Investigators may use research project funding to pay the tuition for graduate students on military scholarships where the provision of their military support includes a prohibition of salary payment from Stanford in certain limited circumstances:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The student has a statement of financial support from their branch of the US military, defining the terms of the student's support while enrolled at Stanford. The agreement must state that the student can receive tuition support from Stanford but may not be paid a salary by Stanford. If this arrangement continues for more than one year, the student should present evidence that the military scholarship is continuing for each year.</li> 
                    <li>The student will average at least 20 hours of work per week on the project for each quarter in which they are paid, earning TAL for a 50% assistantship. This arrangement should also be documented by means of an assistantship agreement.</li> 
                    <li>All records to document this arrangement are kept with the student's records.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>In the case where the student is working on a faculty member's research project and meets all eligibility requirements, the student may be appointed as an RA. The salary line may then be cancelled, leaving the remaining TAL payment in compensation for the work performed.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><strong>(5) Students Working in Schools Other Than Where They Are Enrolled</strong><br> When graduate students are appointed as Teaching or Research Assistants in a school other than the one in which they are enrolled, the school in which the student works is responsible for paying the TAL at the student's home school tuition rate. In the case of Research Assistants, splitting tuition between the sponsored source and the University (either 60%/40% or 81%/19%) is controlled by the school paying the student.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(6) Terminal Graduate Registration (TGR), Terminal Medical Registration (TMR) and Medical School Research Rate (MSRR)</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>TAL <strong>cannot </strong>be carried forward to pay TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition in future quarters.</li> 
                    <li>TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is paid in full by the associated assistantship (see below). The GFS system will not divide TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition and share the cost with university or school funds.</li> 
                    <li>For Research Assistants, TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is charged directly to the source of funds paying the student's salary.</li> 
                    <li>For Teaching Assistants, TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is paid in the same manner as other TAL funding for Teaching Assistants (see section 2, above).</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Amount of TAL</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) Percent Time</strong><br> The amount of TAL earned depends on the percentage of time of the graduate student assistantship appointment(s). See the <a href="http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables">Tuition Allowance Tables</a>.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The minimum assistantship appointment is 10% and provides TAL equal to the value of two units of tuition. (Note: The minimum tuition charged by Stanford is three units, and therefore a 10% assistantship will not provide enough tuition allowance to cover Stanford's minimum unit-based tuition.)</li> 
                    <li>The maximum assistantship appointment during autumn, winter and spring quarters is 50%, and provides TAL equal to the 8-10 unit tuition charge, except in the Law School where they earn the 8-9 unit value and in the MED MD program, where they earn the value of 8 units.</li> 
                    <li>For assistantship appointments of 50-90%, the total TAL earned decreases as the percentage of time increases. (For example: A student's 70% appointment(s) earns the same TAL as a 30% appointment.) For the rules governing appointments greater than 50%, see section 5.b.4 (required pre-approval for exceptions, Autumn, Winter and Spring), 5.c (summer), and 5.d. See also Tuition Allowance tables for Summer Quarter.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(2) Length of Assistantships</strong><br> Appointments are made for a full quarter (see "Percentage and Period of Appointment," Section 5 of this document). Appointments will earn the designated amount of TAL for the full quarter in which the student is appointed.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) Multiple Assistantships</strong><br> Students may hold multiple assistantship appointments, including both RA and TA appointments, simultaneously. At most, the 8-10 unit TAL value may be earned when combining multiple assistantships.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Multiple assistantships totaling 50% or less: </strong>GFS automatically calculates the total combined percentage of the assistantships that will be the basis for the amount of TAL. For example, two 25% assistantship appointments earn a combined TAL equal to a 50% appointment: 8-10 units. (During the academic year, combined appointments should not total more than 50%; see 5.b, above).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Multiple assistantships totaling more than 50% (e.g. in summer): </strong>If entered as one appointment with multiple sources of funding, GFS correctly calculates the combined TAL as described in 5.d.1. If entered as separate appointments, GFS cannot do the calculation: administrators must determine both the reduced total TAL and the proportional cost to each appointment, then adjust each appointment's TAL in GFS.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>(4) Summer Appointments</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In summer quarter, some students may enroll in fewer units than the TAL earned by their assistantship appointment(s). In such cases, the TAL for their Summer Quarter Assistantships is reduced by adjusting the TAL amount in GFS to match the actual tuition amount billed.</li> 
                    <li>Summer appointments are for three months, even though courses may be scheduled for 8 or 10 weeks. If an appointment ends before the end of the full quarter, salary can be ended on the corresponding date, but students will receive the amount of TAL associated with a full-quarter appointment.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>e. Use of TAL<br> (1)</strong> TAL can be used<strong> only</strong> in the quarter in which it was generated by an appointment.<br> <br> <strong>(2) </strong>TAL may be used <strong>only</strong> as a credit against tuition charges. It is:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Not convertible to cash</li> 
                    <li>Not transferable to another student</li> 
                    <li>Not usable for any other charges, such as ASSU fees</li> 
                    <li>Not applicable to tuition charges for Continuing Studies Program courses</li> 
                   </ul>

                   <p>To preserve the focus on the student's academic progress, Stanford University formally limits the number of hours a student may be employed while also holding an assistantship appointment. Graduate students are expected to coordinate additional hourly employment with the assistantship appointment, and with their academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and the academic expectations of their program. Academic departments/programs, offices employing students, and funding sources may also impose employment limitations. Graduate student hourly employment is described in <a href="/chapter-10/subchapter-2/policy-10-2-2" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2</a>: Graduate Student Hourly Employment.</p> 
                   <p>During break periods between quarters--the period between the last day of final examinations and the first day of classes the subsequent quarter--graduate students may be employed full time. Thanksgiving recess is not a break between quarters. Note: The quarter period is different from the assistantship pay periods, as the standard "start" and "stop" dates for assistantships are intended to pay the student continuously including break periods between quarters.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Limit on Hours for U.S. Students</strong><br> During Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters, students on 50% time assistantships may not be employed more than an additional eight hours a week inside Stanford and/or outside of Stanford; those eight hours cannot be in other assistantship positions. During Summer quarter, enrolled graduate students are limited to 36 hours of student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Limit on Hours for International students</strong><br> International students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both University policies on employment and visa requirements that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply. International students are eligible for on-campus employment if they are maintaining their F-1 or J-1 status. During the academic year (Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters), students on F-1 or J-1 visas are limited to a total of 20 hours of employment per week (except the break periods between quarters), including both hourly jobs and assistantship appointments), and including any off-campus employment that they may have been authorized to perform.<strong> </strong>For further information regarding regulations for students with F-1 and J-1 visas, contact<a href="https://bechtel.stanford.edu"> Bechtel International Center</a>.</p>

                   <p>The graduate appointments described in this Guide Memo are designed for and available only to Stanford students.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Time Off</strong><br> Assistantship appointments do not accrue vacation leave.</p> 
                   <p>Students with research or teaching assistantship appointments will receive a lump sum of 24 hours of paid sick time per calendar year, which is available for use during any period of assistantship appointment during the year. Sick time does not carry over from one calendar year to the next.</p> 
                   <p>Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for vacation, jury duty, illness, or related use of sick time should be made individually with the faculty sponsor. To the extent possible, students are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and faculty sponsors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.</p> 
                   <p>Regular semi-monthly salary is paid during periods when sick time is used. When sick time is used, the student notifies Payroll via <a href="https://stanford.service-now.com/finance_payroll_services?id=sc_cat_item&amp;sys_id=75209554135a4b008a9175c36144b0c9" target="_blank">Help Ticket</a>. Sick time accrued for an assistantship appointment is paid only when used to replace work hours during the course of employment as a research or teaching assistant. Otherwise, sick balances are not paid out. Graduate students who have student hourly employment, either concurrently or at different times of the year, will see a separate accounting of sick time accrued for the student hourly employment (see <a href="/chapter-10/subchapter-3/policy-10-3-1" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1</a>: Sick Time for Student Hourly Employees).</p> 
                   <p>Students with research or teaching assistantship appointments may use sick time for themselves or a family member: for absences due to illness; for preventive care or diagnoses, care, or treatment of an existing health condition; or for purposes related to domestic violence, sexual assaults, or stalking.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Health Insurance</strong><br> Eligibility for a health insurance benefit is determined quarterly on the basis of assistantship and fellowship appointments approved as of the payroll deadline of each quarter. Graduate students are eligible for a health insurance subsidy as long as they do not waive Cardinal Care insurance or have their insurance paid fully by an outside source of funds. The Health Insurance subsidy will be paid as follows:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Students with assistantship appointments for 25% time or more per quarter will receive a subsidy paying approximately 50% of the cost of the single-student Cardinal Care premium.</li> 
                    <li>Students with assistantship appointments of less than 25% time per quarter will receive a subsidy paying approximately 25% of the cost of the single-student Cardinal Care premium.</li>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="definitions-and-distinctions"><span class="prefix-container">1. </span>Definitions and Distinctions</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. </strong>Student hourly employment. Stanford University uses student hourly employment to hire Stanford students into jobs that are specifically earmarked for matriculated students. Student workers are supervised in their work, are hired through the PeopleSoft HR system, and must record and approve their work hours. Compensation is established on an hourly basis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of hours worked in each pay period.</p> 
                   <p>These job assignments are incidental to the student’s course of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic quarter on the nature of the work assignment and the number of hours of employment.</p> 
                   <p>All Stanford University student employment is hourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are limited to graduate students (see Admin Guide 10.2.1). Hourly employment should never be used to pay a graduate student for work that is appropriately treated as an assistantship.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. </strong>Graduate student. This policy applies to students who are enrolled in a graduate degree program (any degree except the BA, BS, or BAS). For purposes of student employment, students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as coterminal students are considered undergraduate students while assessed undergraduate tuition and graduate students while assessed graduate tuition.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. </strong>The Graduate Financial Support (GFS) system is the online application used to enter all research and teaching assistantship appointments, fellowships, and other stipend payments for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. It is not used to process hourly employment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. </strong>Job Classification Codes (JCC) are used to categorize all jobs at Stanford. Students should be hired into the appropriate <a href="https://stanford.box.com/s/c7xhv14taumczjyydkhg24bmz6bfjcud" target="_blank">student JCC</a> for the job for which they are employed. Use of the appropriate JCC ensures that the correct expenditure type and fringe benefit rate are applied as wages are paid.</p> 
                   <p><strong>Distinctions from Hourly Employment:</strong></p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Graduate Student Assistantships</strong> are a form of student employment, earning a compensation package including both salary and tuition allowance (TAL) for the performance of research or teaching services to the University as part of the student's academic and professional training and development, see Guide Memo 10.2.1. Hourly employment is not a substitute for an assistantship appointment.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Honorarium </strong>is a stipend payment to recognize a student for an accomplishment or a one-time event or project, such as a recruitment weekend. Honoraria are not used as compensation for employment. Graduate student honorarium payments are processed as stipends in the GFS system.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Student Residence Roles </strong>are held by a core group of students that are responsible for managing the various programmatic components of life in their on campus residence. A nominal stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction with many of these roles. These payments are processed as stipends in the GFS system.&nbsp; International students should consult with Bechtel International Center about the impact of this effort on restrictions related to on-campus employment.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Off-Campus Internships</strong> and <strong>Off-Campus Employment </strong>are not covered by this policy. In both cases, students are encouraged to be mindful that their primary obligation is to their academic program. International students must also adhere to visa requirements&nbsp;and should consult with Bechtel International Center before engaging in any off-campus employment or unpaid opportunity.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Contingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment</strong> is used to hire an individual for a part-time or temporary staff position. Contingent employment must be used for hourly employment assignments for non-matriculated students, such as Visiting Student Researchers, and for matriculated students when on a Leave of Absence. Contingent employment is not normally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students, but must be used for any student working more than 36 hours per week.</li>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="limits-on-hours-of-employment"><span class="prefix-container">2. </span>Limits on Hours of Employment</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p>Graduate students are expected to limit their hours of employment, so that they may devote sufficient attention to their studies. Therefore, graduate students are expected to coordinate the number of hours of employment with their academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and the academic expectations of their program. Additionally, they are expected to coordinate hourly employment with the other forms of financial support that they are receiving. Academic departments/programs, offices employing students, and funding sources may also impose employment limitations.</p> 
                   <p>Limits on hourly employment and related enrollment limitations for graduate students are summarized in Table 1.</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Limit on Hours</strong><br> There are formal limits on the number of hours a student may be employed when also financially supported by assistantships or fellowships.</p> 
                   <p>During Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters, enrolled graduate students are limited to 28 hours of student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments. (International students are subject to additional limitations, see below.) For example, graduate students appointed to 50% (20 hours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an additional eight hours a week; those additional hours cannot be in other assistantship positions. Graduate students with full fellowship funding are limited to additional employment of 8 hours/week hourly employment or a 25% assistantship, but not both. The source of the fellowship or the student’s academic department/program may impose stricter limits.</p> 
                   <p>During Summer quarter, enrolled graduate students are limited to 36 hours of student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments. (International students may be subject to additional limitations, see below.) For example, students on 50% time (20 hours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an additional 16 hours a week; those additional hours can combine either assistantships or hourly employment. In summer, students who are employed more than 8 hours with a 50% assistantship are expected to reduce the number of units of enrollment commensurate with a larger percentage appointment. (This is shown in the <a href="https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary22/index.html">TAL table for Summer Quarter</a>.) Graduate students with full fellowship funding are limited to additional employment of 16 hours/week hourly employment or a 50% assistantship, but not both. The source of the fellowship or the student’s academic department/program may impose stricter limits<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Additional Limits on Hours</strong></p> 
                   <p>During break periods when school is officially not in session, the University does not limit the number of hours graduate students may be employed. For on campus employment, University guidelines on overtime pay apply. Note that graduate student research and teaching assistantships are made for a full quarter and hours associated with assistantships include these break periods. Policy related to assistantships is located in <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-10/subchapter-2/policy-10-2-1" style="letter-spacing: 0.14px;">Administrative Guide 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships</a>.</p> 
                   <p>International students must contact Bechtel International Center for information about off-campus employment authorization&nbsp; (see Bechtel International Center’s website under “<a href="https://bechtel.stanford.edu/immigration/employment">Employment</a>”).</p> 
                   <p>Thanksgiving Break:</p> 
                   <p>Restrictions on student work hours do not apply during Thanksgiving recess, beginning the day after classes end (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes resume.</p> 
                   <p>Between Quarter Breaks:</p> 
                   <p>Restrictions on student work hours do not apply beginning the day after the University final exam period ends (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes begin the following quarter.</p> 
                   <p>For example: students’ employment hours are not limited between the Saturday after Autumn quarter final exams, through the Sunday before Winter classes begin.</p> 
                   <p>Summer Quarter:</p> 
                   <p>Summer quarter employment rules vary depending upon student enrollment and visa status. Refer to the information and chart below for additional information.&nbsp;</p> 
                   <p>Individual university holidays, e.g., President’s Day and Memorial Day, do not constitute a break.</p> 
                   <p>Although university policy does not restrict employment hours during these break periods, individual academic programs may define more restrictive policies. Students must check with their academic program for any restrictions.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Additional Limits on Hours for International Students on F-1 or J-1 Visas</strong></p> 
                   <p>International students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both university policies on employment and visa regulations that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.</p> 
                   <p>International students are eligible for on-campus employment if they are maintaining F-1 or J-1 status (J-1 students must obtain work authorization from Bechtel International Center for both on-campus and off-campus employment). During the academic year (Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters), enrolled students on F-1or J-1 visas are limited to a total of 20 hours of employment per week (except during break periods), including both hourly jobs and assistantship appointment(s), and including any off-campus employment that they may have been authorized to perform.</p> 
                   <p>During Summer quarter, most international students are subject to the general University policies for summer graduate student employment, and their F-1 or J-1 visa does not further restrict their hours of employment. However, any graduate student who is required to enroll full time in summer quarter in order to maintain legal visa status—such as newly admitted students who will start their program in the summer, or those students returning from a leave of absence in the summer—may not work more than a combined total of 20 hours per week.</p> 
                   <p>During University defined break periods as defined in section 2b above, neither the University or federal regulations limit the number of hours international graduate students may be employed, provided they are eligible and intend to register for the next academic quarter.</p> 
                   <p>Further information regarding employment limits for students on F-1 or J-1 visas is available from the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/icenter">Bechtel International Center</a>.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="hiring,-paying-and-supervising-students"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Hiring, Paying and Supervising Students</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Hiring</strong><br> The supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry. The students should be hired into the appropriate Job Classification Code (JCC). The student must be hired into PeopleSoft HR before beginning work. Students who are hired during Summer quarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as Student Hourly Employees using the appropriate Summer Student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work assignment that started during the academic year.</p> 
                   <p>Before hiring a graduate student for hourly employment, a graduate student assistantship, or any other type of appointment through Human Resources the hiring department should contact the student’s academic home department/program to review the appointment (see the <a href="http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/gfs/contacts.html">GFS School contact</a> list). The hourly appointment must be reviewed for appropriateness taking into account:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The student’s academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and other expectations</li> 
                    <li>Other forms of financial support that the student is receiving, including fellowships and assistantships. Funding sources may impose limits on hourly employment</li> 
                    <li>Any limits that the student’s home academic department/program imposes (e.g., program may limit hourly student employment)</li> 
                    <li>Limitations placed on international students</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Students who receive a university award that includes funding to hire graduate students to complete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other effort&nbsp;associated with academic projects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding and hire the student hourly employee.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Wage rates</strong><br> There is no suggested wage scale for hourly employment for graduate students. When setting the hourly wage rate for a graduate student, the following may be taken into consideration:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>The tasks required of the student, including the level of independence, judgment and expertise;</li> 
                    <li>The student’s experience in similar work assignments;</li> 
                    <li>Wage rate paid to other graduate students in department for comparable work.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Payment</strong><br> Departments pay student workers from their own sources of funding.</p> 
                   <p>Hourly student workers must record actual hours worked in Axess Timecard each pay period. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Supervision</strong><br> One person should be named as the student’s immediate supervisor and should be directly accountable for overseeing the student’s work and approving the hours worked in Axess.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Work Schedules and Requirements</strong><br> A student is expected to work the agreed hours, be punctual, and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus employers build in some flexibility in hours given students’ exam schedules, but that is not always possible and students are expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.<strong> </strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Sick Time</strong><br> Sick time provides a mechanism to pay graduate student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons as detailed below. All Stanford student hourly employees receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.</p> 
                   <p>For information about the accrual and use of sick time for student hourly employees, see <a href="/chapter-10/subchapter-3/policy-10-3-1" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1</a>: Sick Time for Student Hourly Employees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. Job Listing</strong><br> Stanford departments wishing to hire graduate students may use the system administered by BEAM (Bridging Education, Ambition and Meaningful Work) to list their job openings. Departments should log onto <a href="https://beam.stanford.edu/">Handshake</a> to post a job. Departments may also use their own means of locating student employees.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Non-Discrimination</strong><br> Non-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in <a href="/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-2#anchor-22831">Guide Memo 2.1.2, section 2.a.</a>, also apply to student employees.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Accrual of Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p>Student hourly employees accrue sick time as follows:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Student hourly employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour worked. This equates to one (1) hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.</li> 
                    <li>Unused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with a maximum limit of 48 hours or six (6) days.</li> 
                    <li>Student hourly employees accrue sick time for all hourly jobs worked at Stanford, regardless of the department of employment. When a student hourly employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the University, the student hourly employee’s sick time balance is maintained as long as the new position starts within 12 months of the date of termination from the first position. If the new position is not a student hourly employee position, the student hourly employee is subject to any sick time policies applicable to the new position, including, without limitation, any policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>b. Recording Sick Time Accrual</strong></p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Sick time is paid only when used to replace scheduled work hours during the course of employment. Otherwise, sick time balances are not paid out.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Student hourly employees are entitled to use accrued sick time beginning on the 90<sup>th</sup> calendar day after the start of employment. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick time is limited to 24 hours or three scheduled work days, whichever is greater, each year of employment. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a student hourly employee has during scheduled work hours.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Sick time is not paid out when a student hourly employee ends employment for any reason, including, without limitation, no longer being employed in a student hourly employee position, leaving the University for any reason, taking a leave of absence, or being in non-enrollment status.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Sick time may be used for the following reasons:</p> 
                   <p><strong>a. Absence Due to Illness or Injury</strong></p> 
                   <p>&nbsp; Sick time may be used when a student hourly employee’s illness or injury prevents the student hourly employee from working.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Medical and Dental Appointments</strong></p> 
                   <p>Sick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition</li> 
                    <li>Preventive care</li> 
                    <li>Those appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">Sick time may be used by a student hourly employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking in order to:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"> 
                    <li>Obtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or his or her child</li> 
                    <li>Seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li> 
                    <li>Participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>d. Family Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">Student hourly employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a student hourly employee’s family&nbsp; member. For the purpose of this policy, a family member includes the student hourly employee’s:</p> 
                   <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"> 
                    <li>Spouse or registered domestic partner</li> 
                    <li>Children of the student hourly employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the student hourly employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or dependency status)</li> 
                    <li>Parents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a student hourly employee or the student hourly employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the student hourly employee was a minor)</li> 
                    <li>Brothers and sisters</li> 
                    <li>Grandparents or grandchildren</li> 
                    <li>Other family member dependent on the student hourly employee and living in the student hourly employee's household</li>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Notification of Absence</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;">The student hourly employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how student hourly employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the student hourly employee should provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the student hourly employee should provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a student hourly employee requests to use accrued sick time and the student hourly employee’s use of sick time is within applicable limits per year of employment, the request should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;">To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Medical Confirmation</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;"><strong>(1) Medical confirmation related to use of sick time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Acceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a student hourly employee's use of the first 24 hours of sick time (or three scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a student hourly employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;"><strong>(2) Medical confirmation related to possible abuse or misuse of sick time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">If the University has reasonable basis to believe that a student hourly employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 24 hours or three scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a student hourly employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (<em>i.e</em>., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;"><strong>(3) Acceptable medical evidence</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:7.0pt;">Acceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner’s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the student hourly employee is released to return to work.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Reporting Sick Time Use</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:5.0pt;">Student hourly employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. Student hourly employees may only be paid for the number of sick time hours that they have accrued and which is available to them. The use of sick time is limited to 24 hours or three scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Up to 24 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a student hourly employee has three scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 24 hours, the student hourly&nbsp;&nbsp; employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources office. Student hourly employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. For information about Axess see this <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html" target="_blank">Time &amp; Leave System overview</a>.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:5.0pt;"><strong>d. Sick Time Credit Date</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:5.0pt;">Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. Sick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a student hourly employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the student hourly employee should speak to the local Human Resources office for assistance.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;"><strong>e. Tax Status</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;">Income that the student hourly employee receives for sick time is taxable. Applicable taxes are deducted.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Multiple Forms of Employment</strong></p> 
                   <p>Student hourly employees who are employed by Stanford in other ways are affected as follows:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Assistantships: Graduate students who have assistantship appointments, either concurrently or at different times of the year, will see a separate accounting of sick time accrued for the assistantship appointment. (For more information, see <a href="/10-2-1" target="_blank">Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1</a>: Graduate Student Assistantships)</li> 
                    <li>Temporary or casual employment: Students who are hired as temporary or casual employees in the same 12 month period in which they were student hourly employees will have previously accrued sick time, up to the applicable limits, available for use. Temporary or casual employment for students typically occurs in summer, following graduation, or when a student is on a leave of absence</li> 
                    <li>Scholarship, fellowship, and stipend support: Students who receive stipend support for a scholarship, fellowship, or other reasons, are not Stanford employees and do not receive a sick time benefit</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p style="margin-left: 4.5pt;"><strong>g. Sources of Funds for Sick Time</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;">As sick time is used to replace scheduled work time, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record. Departments employing a student on Federal Work Study must provide their own unrestricted funding to pay for sick time when used. This unrestricted PTA should be recorded on the timecard as sick time is used.</p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;"><strong>h. Applicable Laws</strong></p> 
                   <p style="margin-left:4.5pt;">The intent of this Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522.</p>

                   <p>Members of the Stanford community are required to act with honesty and integrity and comply with applicable laws at all times when transacting University business. This guide memo clarifies that all forms of bribery and corruption are absolutely prohibited, provides guidance regarding what constitutes bribery and corruption, and requires reporting of actual or suspected incidents of bribery and corruption. This guide memo has been drafted to comply with the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Many countries also have local laws prohibiting bribery which must be followed by members of the Stanford community when conducting activities in or involving those countries, including contracting with third parties whose acts can pose liability for the University under the FCPA and local laws. Bribery does not need to take place in the foreign country to fall within the purview of FCPA or local anti-bribery laws. For example, entertainment provided in the United States for the purpose of influencing decisions and related activities could violate the FCPA and local anti-bribery laws. In addition to institutional consequences to the University, individuals who violate anti-bribery laws may be subject to personal fines or criminal prosecution.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Bribery</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong>(1) </strong>To offer, give, or promise to another person any financial or other advantage with the intention to induce or reward that person or another person to perform his or her responsibilities or duties improperly or to give an improper advantage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2) </strong>To request, agree to receive, accept, or direct a financial or other advantage for oneself or others if such advantage is intended to induce or reward improper performance of one’s responsibilities or duties or to gain an improper advantage.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3) </strong>To do either (1) or (2) without the intention to induce or reward improper performance of duties or responsibilities or gain an improper advantage, but which nonetheless could reasonably be interpreted as such an inducement or reward.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Facilitation Payments</strong><br> Facilitation or “grease” payments are any payments, no matter how small, given to a government official to increase the speed at which they do their job. Such payments are not permitted under this policy. Only a payment to speed up a governmental act that is <u>not</u> discretionary in nature would potentially be considered a permissible payment. For example, this could include speeding up a business registration license or permit approval or customs processing, only if such government acts simply involved the payment of a standard fee and the permit or registration was automatically issued.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Public Official</strong><br> Public officials include not only employees working in government departments, but also may include employees of government owned or controlled commercial enterprises, universities and research institutions, international organizations, political parties and political candidates. Public officials also include the family members of any of the employee groups listed above.</p>

                  <h2 class="policy-subsection-title" id="policy"><span class="prefix-container">3. </span>Policy</h2>
                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Bribery Prohibited</strong><br> Stanford University has a zero tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption. All forms of bribery are prohibited. A bribe does not actually have to take place or be accepted; offering or agreeing to accept a bribe is itself a violation of the Policy. Facilitation payments are not permitted under this guide memo, even where such payments may be allowable under U.S. law.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Forms of Bribery</strong><br> A bribe is defined as anything of value. Bribery can take many forms in addition to cash, for example:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Cash equivalent such as stock shares;</li> 
                    <li>Unreasonable gifts, entertainment, travel expenses or other hospitality;</li> 
                    <li>Unwarranted rebates or excessive commissions (e.g. to sales or marketing agents);</li> 
                    <li>Unwarranted allowances or expense reimbursements;</li> 
                    <li>Political/charitable contributions;</li> 
                    <li>Uncompensated use of University services or facilities;</li> 
                    <li>Kickbacks; or</li> 
                    <li>Anything else of value</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p><strong>c. Prevention of Bribery</strong><br> Members of the Stanford community should assess the risk of bribery in the activities under their purview and take appropriate care to prevent and detect bribery. Certain countries have a high incidence of corruption, and particular care should be taken when undertaking activities in or involving those countries. For information regarding high risk countries, see the <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019/results">Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index</a>. Appropriate steps could involve training of employees concerning this guide memo and reporting requirements, requiring due diligence before engaging third party service providers, ensuring that contracts contain anti-bribery provisions, and requesting guidance from the Office of the General Counsel before expanding operations into a new geographic location. Failure to take such steps to prevent and detect bribery creates legal risk for the University and potential personal liability for individuals involved.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Dealing with Government Officials</strong><br> While this Policy applies to both the public and private sectors, dealing with public officials poses a particularly high risk related to bribery and corruption. Members of the Stanford community should be especially cautious when dealing with public employees, including faculty and staff at public universities or workers at state-owned enterprises. Local laws often severely limit what a public employee may receive and there can be greater legal liability for giving inappropriate advantages to a public employee.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Dealing with Third Parties</strong><br> Stanford could be liable for improper payments made by a third party acting on its behalf, such as a contractor, consultant, agent, or research partner, even if the University did not authorize the payment. When entering into a relationship with a third party, members of the Stanford community should complete sufficient due diligence to ensure that the retained individual or organization does not have a history of corrupt payments, and understands and agrees that they are not authorized to engage in bribery on Stanford’s behalf.&nbsp; The level of due diligence required may vary depending on the level of risk involved in the transaction, e.g. whether the third party will be interacting with government officials on behalf of the University or whether the services will occur in a country that involves a high risk of corruption. Care should be taken to ensure vendors’ understanding of and commitment to compliance with anti-bribery laws when entering into engagements with expeditors to provide logistical support for international activities such as air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding, vendor consolidation, customs clearance, and distribution activities. Faculty and staff intending to retain firms for freight forwarding or customs services should first consult with Procurement (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/iprocure/howto/create_standard_req.html">www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/iprocure/howto/create_standard_req.html</a>).</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. </strong>At a minimum, members of the Stanford community should ensure that third parties do not have a history of violations of anti-bribery laws, provide them a copy of this guide memo, which can be located at <a href="https://adminguide.stanford.edu/print/chapter-12/subchapter-1/policy-12-1-2">adminguide.stanford.edu/print/chapter-12/subchapter-1/policy-12-1-2</a>, and regularly audit their activities to ensure ongoing compliance. Any agreements with third parties must include provisions that they will comply with the FCPA and any applicable local anti-bribery laws.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Global HR Programs</strong><br> University Human Resources and Global HR Programs are responsible for developing, monitoring and overseeing employment policies and providing the University with support services necessary to attain staffing objectives outside of the US.</p> 
                   <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">b. Human Resources Manager</strong><br> <span style="font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.4em;">Human Resources Manager is the person responsible for administering recruiting and hiring policy for each unit or organization, in consultation with Global HR Programs.</span></p> 
                   <p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Hiring Supervisors</strong><br> Hiring Supervisors are those faculty and staff designated to make staff hiring decisions. Hiring supervisors are responsible for making such decisions in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the University and set forth in this Guide Memo. Each hiring supervisor is accountable for his/her actions in matters relating to applicable sections of this policy and compliance with regulations governing employment and performance in the country of hire. Questions on these policies should be referred to the Human Resources Manager and/or Global HR Programs.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Compliance with Laws in Country of Hire</strong><br> Employees assigned or working outside of the US are subject to applicable law in the country of hire as well as University policy and procedures when not in conflict with in-country law.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Business Purpose</strong><br> Hiring, transfer or assignment of regular staff outside of the US must be supported by a demonstrable University business purpose, and approved in writing by the cognizant School Dean or VP. Copies of such approvals should be forwarded to Global HR Programs and FMS/Global Business Services.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Administrative Costs</strong><br> Employing workers outside of the US typically involves significant additional costs in light of the regulatory and operational complexity involved in such assignments. Accordingly the supervisor hiring or assigning the employee outside of the US is responsible for ensuring that the added expense of such an assignment is covered by the applicable budget for the duration of the expected employment.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Work Authorization</strong><br> Work authorization and immigration issues may require significant lead time. HR Managers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate documents are secured prior to employment outside of the US. Human Resources cannot process a hire until the proper work authorization is obtained. Candidates who are citizens or hold on-going work authorization for the country in which the project is located are considered “in-country” hires. These employees may be paid in the country’s currency by a University-approved payroll provider.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Consulting Arrangements</strong><br> It should be noted with caution what may appear to be a consulting arrangement by US standards could in fact constitute an employment relationship in another country, potentially triggering employment, tax and other regulatory considerations.</p> 
                   <div> 
                    <p><strong>f. Employment Rights and Preferences of Former and Current Regular Staff</strong><br> In recognition of the unique nature of global operations, campus policy relating to reemployment does not apply. The University will reemploy or return to active employment workers in the country of original hire to the extent required by law.</p> 
                    <p><strong>g. Employment of Related Persons</strong><br> University guidelines (as detailed in 2.1.2.c) regarding the Employment of Related Persons apply to global employees.</p> 
                    <p><strong>h. Age as a Hiring Factor</strong><br> Consideration of age as a hiring factor will be in compliance with employment regulation in the country of hire.</p>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Job Descriptions</strong><br> Global HR Programs will maintain a library of global job descriptions in a standard format. The hiring supervisor identifies the functions of the job, defines and describes the duties and responsibilities of the position, including required training, and develops objective criteria for the selection process. The unit Human Resources Manager reviews the description for clarity and content and works with Global HR Programs to define a recruitment strategy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Announcing Job Openings</strong><br> All regular vacancies must be listed with the unit’s Human Resource office and Global HR Programs. Due to the specific requirement of working outside of the US, global jobs are not posted online in the Stanford Careers website.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Recruitment of Applicants</strong><br> Hiring supervisors should consult with the unit’s HR Manager, and ask for a copy of the Global Activities Checklist for Stanford University Human Resources Managers.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Search Firms</strong><br> Global hiring situations may require the use of a search firm in the country of hire to develop a candidate pool. Consult with the unit’s Human Resources Manager and Global HR Programs before making any arrangement with an outside firm or agency.</p> 
                  </div>

                  <div class="policy-subsection-body">
                   <p><strong>a. Employment Application Form</strong><br> All interviewed applicants must complete and sign an application form. Applicants may cross out sections on the form that do not apply in the country of hire. At a minimum, the form must contain the employee’s legal name, current and former employer and dates of employment, including latest salary information, and highest education level with name of school awarding degree or diploma.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Interviewing</strong><br> The hiring manager and/or interview committee interviews the candidates selected through the recruitment process. Initial interviews for job assignments outside of the US may utilize video conferencing and/or video recording. In all cases, the final candidate should be interviewed by the hiring supervisor in person. Finalists should be scheduled for a phone or video interview with campus stakeholders if appropriate.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Testing</strong><br> When used, approved tests must directly relate to essential job functions and be given to all applicants or finalists under the same or equivalent conditions. The test must be scored, evaluated and used as a selection factor equally for all applicants or finalists.</p> 
                   <p><strong>d. Reference Checks</strong><br> The hiring supervisor is required to obtain a minimum of two reference checks from previous employers. Reference checks must be part of the candidate’s evaluation and may be used as a factor in the hiring decision if the information is job-related. No offer of employment can be made before completing the hiring process, including reference checks.</p> 
                   <p><strong>e. Background Checks</strong><br> Background checks (appropriate to the country in which the hire is being made) are conducted for all final candidates. No offer of employment can be made before completing the hiring process, including a background check.</p> 
                   <p><strong>f. Criminal Records</strong><br> A criminal record will not automatically disqualify a job applicant. An applicant with a criminal record can only be barred from employment if the circumstances are reviewed by the unit’s Human Resources Manager, Global HR Programs and Employee and Labor Relations. In many countries, potential employers may not request prior criminal conviction records for job applicants. Stanford’s background check provider will advise on what information can be legally obtained during the hiring process.</p> 
                   <p><strong>g. False and/or Misleading Statements</strong><br> Withdraw from consideration any applicant found to have misleading and/or false statements on the employment application or other documents.</p> 
                   <p><strong>h. Review of Personnel Files</strong><br> Hiring supervisors have access to personnel files of current and former University employees who are finalists for the position. No offer of employment can be made before the hiring supervisor or Human Resources reviews the personnel files.</p>

                   <p><strong>a. Hiring Decisions</strong><br> The hiring supervisor and/or next level of management is responsible for judging the relative qualifications of each applicant and for making the hiring decision, consistent with University policy and applicable governmental laws and regulations. The unit’s Human Resources Manager and Global HR Programs is responsible for reviewing proposed hiring decisions and for facilitating compliance with each country’s regulations, laws, and/or University employment policies.</p> 
                   <p><strong>b. Employment Offers</strong><br> (1) Timing of Offer<br> Employment offers should be made after the employment action (including in-hire salary) has received all required approvals and after successful completion of the background check.<br> (2) Employment Offers<br> An offer letter must be issued by the hiring department to the successful applicant for positions with work locations outside of the US, using an approved country offer letter template. Depending on the country of hire, an employment contract may also be required. All such documentation should be reviewed with Global HR Programs to assure conformity with law in the country of hire and University policy.</p> 
                   <p><strong>c. Documentation and Record Keeping</strong><br> (1) Pre-Employment<br> New, transferred, rehired or promoted employees may not start work in the new position until all appropriate forms have been signed and processed. This may include an employment contract or agreement, government tax withholding forms, or other forms as required in the country of hire.<br> (2) Patent and Copyright Agreement<br> All employees must complete a Stanford-approved Patent and Copyright Agreement Form as a condition of employment.</p>
