					<description><![CDATA[The destiny of Ukraine and much of the world is in the balance now. If Ukraine falls, the cancer of war will spread to the rest of the world and the law of the jungle will be a new global order where a big country can take over a small country. If Ukraine defeats the Russian aggression, another Berlin wall will fall and there will be another spring on the remnants of the Soviet empire that call themselves Russian Federation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many students in Oakland are facing a fifth and possibly sixth year of disruption. How do we build momentum toward a new way of “doing school,” especially for those who have been systematically marginalized and underserved? With a state budget surplus and new initiatives for schools and children, the hope of transforming public education is larger than it has been in many decades. However, we need more than funding to work toward equitable outcomes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2021 was a better year than 2020, but there is still much room for improvement. The pandemic continued, and new strains of the virus have emerged &#8211; but we have effective vaccines. Leorah and I were vaccinated twice and received a booster shot. We continue to wear a mask and avoid large crowds – but ... <a href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2021/12/24/my-annual-review-2021/">Continue reading  &#187;</a>]]></description>

A group that can turn the joy and beauty of a birth into a crime will never change, or honor any agreement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, I have a couple of very different anniversaries. As a 10 year old school boy in CAmbridge I still have a vivid memory of June 5 1944,when the sky filled with thousands of allied planes on their way to bomb the landing areas in Normandy. Some were towing gliders which would land troops behind ... <a href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2021/06/05/d-day-aids/">Continue reading  &#187;</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The year 2020 was the worst year I can recall. The pandemic that emerged in January accelerated during the late winter and early spring, stabilized in the summer, and remerged with cooler temperatures. We’ve had more than 300,000 fatalities in the US and close to 2 million globally, and the toll is rising.

					<description><![CDATA[The way UC Berkeley schedules classes is pretty nutty. It’s not just that they begin 10 minutes after the announced time, with a 10 AM class actually starting on “Berkeley Time” at 10:10 AM and a course scheduled for 3:30 PM-5 PM commencing at 3:40 PM. That would be needlessly confusing in itself. But what ... <a href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2020/08/07/nows-our-chance-to-kill-berkeley-time/">Continue reading  &#187;</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do we teach? What outcomes do we seek in our students when we step into the classroom or create a learning opportunity? I seek a variety of outcomes: some easy to accomplish, others exceedingly difficult. On the easiest end of the spectrum, I often expose students to facts, formulas – essentially knowledge they need ... <a href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2020/06/29/we-need-protagonists-of-color-and-diversity-in-our-case-discussion-classrooms/">Continue reading  &#187;</a>]]></description>
