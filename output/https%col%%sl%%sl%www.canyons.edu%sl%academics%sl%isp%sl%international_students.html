                <p><strong>Commencement: </strong>A formal graduation ceremony that celebrates recent graduates of the institution with their family and friends. </p>
                <p><strong>Continuing Education:</strong> This typically refers to part-time formal education for working adults. Oftentimes professional certifications may require continuing education credit—though not all necessarily require college coursework. </p>

                <p><strong>Competency-Based Education (CBE): </strong>Method of instruction and evaluation based more on the students’ mastery of the material than time spent in seat.

            <h3>Can I transfer in units from a college from my home country?</h3>
            <p>While it is possible to transfer in units, a student would need to first have their units evaluated by a NACES approved translation service (link). Once a student receives their results, they would need to make an appointment with a counselor to go over the next steps. </p>
