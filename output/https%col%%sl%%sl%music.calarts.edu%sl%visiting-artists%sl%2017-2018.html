                    <p>Grammy-nominated Lande is considered one of the premiere improvisational jazz pianists today. He began piano at age 4, studied at Williams College &amp; moved to San Francisco in 1969. He has mostly carved out his own singular path throughout his career, taking the innovations of Bill Evans several steps further. In 1973 he recorded with Jan Garbarek and Ted Curson and in the mid-1970's had started his own jazz school. In 1976 he formed the quartet Rubisa Patrol which recorded for ECM and lasted until 1983. After teaching for three years in Switzerland, Lande in 1987 moved to Boulder, Colorado. He appears in many of the "Who's Who in Jazz" encyclopedias available today for his role in the development of "Chamber Jazz." </p>

                    <p>Jonathan Stehney is a bassoonist whose focus is contemporary and&nbsp;experimental music. Jonathan has traveled throughout the United States as well as&nbsp;abroad performing new works for bassoon and contrabassoon.

Jon's studies have brought him abroad several times where he studied&nbsp;extensively with Pascal Gallois, Paul Riveaux and the EIC. &nbsp;He received his BFA in&nbsp;performance from Calarts in 2004, his masters and PSD from SFCM, and his DMA&nbsp;from SUNY Stonybrook.</p>

                    <p>Scott Colley’s stature as a leading bassist in the field of improvised music is well known, and easily measured. Colley’s been called “one of the leading bassists of our postbop era, and a composer-bandleader of quietly serious resolve” by The New York Times, while musical colleagues, like saxophonist Joshua Redman, praise him for being “one of the most musical bassists playing today. To me, he seems to have…this natural, intuitive, empathic sense of how to bring the most out of the other musicians and the music he’s playing.”</p>

                    <p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: FreeSans, Arimo, 'Droid Sans', Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">This course is set as a 24 hour camping experience in the Los Angeles National Forest. Arriving at&nbsp;11 a.m.&nbsp;the participants will be exposed to basic techniques to sustain life in a natural environment, such as making a shelter for the night and building a fire, this as means to connect with the basic concepts and experiences of Survival Skills which emphasize the use of the senses, awareness of the environment, and the act of being present. The day will evolve into a series of guided and free improvisations for the voice among the participants. This course is facilitated by guest artist and survival expert, Manu Toigo in collaboration with jazz improviser, Meltem Ege, and experimental vocalist, Carmina Escobar. Manu’s interest in survival began the day she was born in far North Queensland, Australia. Her life growing up on a farm forced many encounters with dangerous wildlife, including several of the world’s top ten deadliest snakes, wild dingoes, poisonous spiders, kangaroos, wild boars, and saltwater crocodiles. This was true backcountry living from having chickens for food and growing fruits and vegetables. Life was very basic living conditions and excluded from worldly knowledge. From an early age, Manu had to adapt and improvise to the tough environment thrown at her. Manu was exposed not only to the dangers of farming activity, but also a climate of extreme heat and humidity and the seasonal Cyclones. She learned at an early age to rely on instincts and common sense. It was a hard, tough life and one you learned quickly from your mistakes. Many experiences taught her to rely upon her instincts and situational awareness. This has been a crucial asset when setting foot into the Wilderness and unknown territories.</span></p>

His work explores a participatory approach to making music through touch, taste, and process using everyday objects that point to who we are and where we live. His work is best characterized by its relationship to site and architecture, inviting the listener to experience sound in situ.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>Kallmyer completed his MFA in 2009 at California Institute of the Arts while studying with Wadada Leo Smith, Wolfgang von Schweinitz, Aashish Khan, and Sara Roberts. Since then, Kallmyer has worked closely with the art collective Machine Project (LA) creating over 100 projects since 2009 at institutions across the United States. As a performer, Chris plays with the modern-music-collective wild Up, who the New York Times called “…a raucous, grungy, irresistibly exuberant…fun-loving, exceptionally virtuosic family.”&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Los Angeles-based artist Ron Athey has been working at the vanguard of performance art for 25 years. Self-taught, his work developed out of post-punk/pre-goth scenes, and begins with Premature Ejaculation (PE), an early 1980s collaboration with Rozz Williams. Their approach to performance art was informed by the club actions of Johanna Went and the formulation of Industrial Culture (the idea of psycho/neuro acoustics in sound performance). Athey's work often experiments with performing in a trance state, not unlike the Pentecostal spirit states he attained in his childhood religious experiences. In the 1990s, Athey formed a company of performers and made Torture Trilogy, a series of works that addressed the AIDS pandemic directly through memorializing and philosophical reflection. This work is characterized by the physical intensity of 1970s body-art canon (e.g. COUM Transmission, Carolee Schneeman and the Viennese Actionists). These performances toured internationally. The trilogy's final chapter, <em>Deliverance</em>, was an Arts Council England commission and premiered at the ICA London. </p>

                     Jaap Blonk (born 1953 in Woerden, Holland) is a self-taught composer, performer and poet. He went to university for mathematics and musicology but never finished those studies. In the late 1970s he took up saxophone and started to compose music. A few years later he discovered his potential as a vocal performer, at first in reciting poetry and later on in improvisations and his own compositions. For almost two decades the voice was his main means for the discovery and development of new sounds. From around the year 2000 on, Blonk started work with electronics, at first using samples of his own voice, then extending the field to include pure sound synthesis as well. He took a year off of performing in 2006. As a result, his renewed interest in mathematics made him start a research of the possibilities of algorithmic composition for the creation of music, visual work and poetry. As a vocalist, Jaap Blonk is unique for his powerful stage presence and almost childlike freedom in improvisation, combined with a keen grasp of structure. He has performed around the world, on all continents. With the use of live electronics the scope and range of his concerts has acquired a considerable extension.

                    <p>Rachel Beetz will present in the performer/composer forum on the development of <em>The Winter Stars</em> sound installation from inspiration through creation and reception. <em>The Winter Stars</em> developed from the Script/Rescript recital project which examined contrapuntal textures of solo flute works in collaboration with visual artist Nichole Speciale. This collaboration led to the process of graphic score realization that is essential to <em>The Winter Stars</em> creation. This presentation will cover the unexpected development of her creative practice from one that was centered on performing challenging works to one that includes composition and installations.</p>

Developed during a residency at the EMS electronic music studios in Stockholm, the piece translates the performer’s sound&nbsp;and&nbsp;aspects of their biological functions (brainwaves and muscle movements) into control signals that affect the live electronics, such that the form of the music itself is partially generated and manipulated through biofeedback&nbsp;processes largely outside the performers’ control.&nbsp;</p>

He has also had a long involvement with Indonesian traditional and experimental music, in particular the Minangkabau music of West Sumatra.&nbsp;Dr. Dewar is an Associate Professor in New College and the School of Music at the University of Alabama.</p>

Recent compositions include "close-up" for electroacoustic sextet, written for Ensemble Studio6; "everything has changed/nothing has changed" for orchestra, given its premiere by the SWR Symphony Orchestra conducted by Peter Rundel in February 2017; and the first installment of "natural causes", a work in progress for the ensemble <em>Musikfabrik</em>, given its premiere in May 2017. Current projects include new works for ELISION, with whom Richard Barrett has been working regularly since 1990, and for the Los Angeles-based ensemble <em>gnarwhallaby</em>. Ongoing performative collaborations include with Paul Obermayer (in FURT), Evan Parker, and several other improvising ensembles such as <em>SKEIN</em> (with Achim Kaufmann, Frank Gratkowski, Wilbert de Joode and others) and <em>Colophony</em> (with Jon Rose and Meinrad Kneer). Richard Barrett’s principal composition teacher was Peter Wiegold, and he currently resides in Belgrade.

                    <p>Music: A child prodigy, born into a renowned family of musicians, Shenkar studied vocal from the age of two, violin from the age of five, and performed his first concert at the age of seven. His 1980 release, "Who's To Know", and Phil Collins' solo debut, "Face Value", introduced the unique sound of Shenkar's own invention, the 10 string stereophonic Double Violin, to listeners around the world. The Double Violin, designed by Shenkar and built by Ken Parker, covers the entire range of the orchestra's double bass, cello, viola and violin. The combination of Shenkar's mesmerizing vocals, double violin and also as a composer has brought him worldwide acclaim as a musical innovator. He is a virtuoso vocalist/violinist (with a five and a half octave vocal range), composer and record producer who has sold over 35 million on his recordings and his guest appearances throughout his career have put him in the highest esteem among his peers.</p>

                    <p><em>Music:</em> David Lopato’s&nbsp;music reflects an involvement with such diverse forms as modern jazz, stride piano, avant-garde classical music, blues, latin and various world musics, most notably those of Indonesia, where he has lived and studied Javanese gamelan. His love of these seemingly disparate traditions has resulted in a body of music that is both universal and personal. Although his main instrument is piano, his interest in other, more exotic timbres has led him to explore new techniques for "preparing" the piano, as well as incorporate other percussion instruments and electronics into his work. He has worked extensively with computers, MIDI, and related digital media to facilitate the creation and realization of his own music and that of other musicians. David Lopato was born in 1954 in Brooklyn, NY. His studies include a B.A. in music composition from&nbsp;Yale University, graduate work in African drumming at&nbsp;<em>California Institute of the Arts</em>&nbsp;and Javanese gamelan at&nbsp;Akademie Seni Krawitan&nbsp;Indonesia&nbsp; in&nbsp;Surakarta, Java&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Fulbright Scholar. He has performed his own compositions throughout the world as a soloist, leader of his own trio, quintet and ten-piece ensembles. </p>

                    <p><em>Music:</em> Musician Michael Cain’s name is not well known by the general listening public, but he surely should be. When not making his impression on the next generation of musicians as an educator at The Eastman School of Music in Rochester, the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston or his present faculty position at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba Canada, the keyboardist has been working with some notable jazz artists including Ravi Coltrane, Greg Osby, MeShell Ndege Ocello, Robin Eubanks and most notably a nine year stretch with drummer Jack DeJohnette. Mr. Cain’s latest offering is the celestial sounds of <em>Sola</em> where he assembles two distinctively different bands playing from two geographical locations, Las Vegas and New York, to make an album that captivates the listener with deep grooves, inherent musicality and a palpable sense of equanimity. </p>

His method is multiplication of sound as a way to make the instruments transcend themselves. The sound of the individual instrument dissolves and reappears as untouched unheard sound. A landscape of sound open to everybody.</p>

                    <p><em>Music:&nbsp; Sun Ra once spoke a future where the mere thought of a place would take somebody there. In the past future of today, Ras G explores space and time through his ancient/futuristic music. Dusty, ethereal and bugged out, the Crate Creator's beats bring the past to the future. Back On The Planet, _G's first Brainfeeder release in years, finds the blunted master of the beat guiding his Afrikan Space Program further out than ever.&nbsp;Since his arrival on the planet, Ras G has called Los Angeles his base. Growing up in South Central, _G was tapping into his innate knowledge while having the earthly experience of living in the "ghetto." Gravitating towards the turntables early, _G spent formative years DJing spots like Project Blowed and Five On The Black Hand Side in Leimert Park until his cousin Wolverine introduced him to the SP-1200 and thoughts of production became realities. Equally informed by the looped-up dust of classic boom-bap and the avant-garde esotericism of free jazz, _G began paving his own path in the beats. He cut his teeth in the early days of Low End Theory and in precursor nights like JuJu and Sketchbook. Day long hangouts at record spots like Aaron's (RIP) and Poo Bah's laid the foundation for projects, live experimentations and new experiences. A key pillar in the Los Angeles community, _G is the power-forward of the Brainfeeder crew, down since day one.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> </em></p>

                    <p><em>Music: </em>Rich and powerful musical language and a strong sense of drama have made Scottish-American composer <strong>Thea Musgrave</strong> one of the most respected and exciting contemporary composers in the Western world. Her works are performed in major concert halls, festivals, and radio stations on both sides of the Atlantic. Known for the clarity of her invention, the skill of her orchestrations, and the power of her musical communication, Musgrave has consistently explored new means of projecting essentially dramatic situations in her music, frequently altering and extending the conventional boundaries of instrumental performance by physicalizing their musical and dramatic impact: both without programmatic content. With such a large and varied career and catalogue, Thea Musgrave is frequently interviewed and questioned about being a "woman" composer, to which she has replied; "Yes, I am a woman; and I am a composer. But rarely at the same time."</p>
