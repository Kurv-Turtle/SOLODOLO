            <h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>CEA Withdrawal Refund Policy<br></strong><strong>Withdrawal Dates </strong></h4>
            <p>A withdrawal date is the last day a student can withdraw from a program and not be held responsible for full payment or be eligible for a refund (see Refund Policies section for more information). All final payment due dates will be set no later than the withdrawal date. All students must be paid-in-full and/or have submitted the required Financial Aid forms by the withdrawal date. Any student wishing to withdraw from their program must express their intent to withdraw in writing prior to the withdrawal date. All withdrawal notifications must be received via fax, mail or email. Verbal notification will not be accepted. Once a withdrawal notification has been received, CEA will acknowledge receipt of notification by sending a withdrawal confirmation email to the student. Any student that has not submitted payment and/or valid Financial Aid Forms by their program withdrawal date may be withdrawn from their program for non-payment (please See Outstanding Balances section for more information). Refer to the Program Info tab on your MyCEA Account for your program’s specific withdrawal date.</p>
            <p>If the withdrawal date falls on a weekend, the following business day will be honored.</p>
            <h4><strong>Refund Policies </strong></h4>
            <p class="Default">When students are enrolled in a CEA study abroad program, they are automatically eligible for the Standard CEA Refund Policy at no extra cost above the study abroad application and program price. However, CEA recommends they enroll in the <strong>CEA<i>Secure</i>™ </strong>plan, which allows students to receive a refund for any one of the covered reasons described below up until one calendar week before their program start date. If they choose not to enroll in CEA<i>Secure</i>™, all refund requests must be sent to CEA’s Arizona Headquarters in writing on or before the program’s final withdrawal date to be eligible for a refund. All withdrawal requests must be sent via fax, mail or email. No verbal requests are accepted. We will acknowledge receipt of student requests by a Withdrawal Confirmation email. All refund decisions will be made by CEA staff.&nbsp;Students who withdraw in writing on, or prior to, their program withdrawal date are not responsible for final payment and may be entitled to a refund of payments already made to CEA, minus the application fee and program confirmation.</p>
            <p>No refunds will be given to students who withdraw from their program after the withdrawal date or to students who are withdrawn by CEA for non-payment. Likewise, students who withdraw after the program withdrawal date are still 100% responsible for final payment, regardless of participation. Any student that leaves a CEA program early after arriving on site will not be granted a refund.</p>
            <p>Students using Financial Aid or loans are responsible for their entire program cost if their Financial Aid or loans are rescinded after their program withdrawal date or if they choose to withdraw after their program withdrawal date (please see the Financial Aid and Outstanding Balances sections).</p>
            <p><strong>Special Situations: </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Academic Year Programs</strong>: Academic Year students who wish to withdraw at the end of the fall semester/trimester are still subject to CEA's academic year pricing structure (see Program Price/Final Payment section). Academic Year students should be aware of the withdrawal date for the winter and/or spring portion of their selected program. Notification in writing must be sent to the CEA Headquarters in Arizona, in addition to your CEA resident director see Change of Program section). Students who have paid their AY program in full will receive a refund of the remaining 40% of the program price (spring portion) providing that their withdrawal notification is received prior to the spring semester withdrawal date. Any discount given will be forfeited.</p>
            <p><strong>Multiple Program Students</strong>: Multiple program students who have confirmed their participation on multiple programs and wish to withdraw from one or more sessions are subject to CEA's withdrawal and refund policies for the cost of their remaining programs. Multiple program students should be aware of the withdrawal date for the remaining programs. Written notification must be sent to the CEA Headquarters in Arizona in addition to your CEA Program/Campus Director (see Change of Program section). Any discount given is forfeited for the remaining sessions.</p>
            <p>With CEASecure™, students may withdraw from their CEA program for any covered reason up to one calendar week before the program’s start date and receive a full refund of program fees paid, minus the $95 application fee, the non-refundable program confirmation fee ($500 for semester and summer programs) and the cost of the CEASecure™ plan. Covered reasons are:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Medical – If a student or an immediate family member of the student becomes seriously ill, is seriously injured in an accident or dies</li>
             <li>Terrorist Attack – If the U.S. Department of State determines that there has been a terrorist attack against U.S. interests within the host country of a student’s program site and issues an official Travel Warning that Americans should not travel to that city</li>
             <li>Job Loss - If a parent or legal guardian of a student is laid off from work or loses his/her job as a result of a general staff reduction or position elimination</li>
             <li>Total Destruction of a Student's Primary Residence – If the student's primary place of residence is destroyed by a natural disaster, fire or explosion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your trip is interrupted after the start of your program, <strong>CEA<i>Secure</i></strong>™ provides limited refund coverage for your protection as follows:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Medical – If a student or an immediate family member of a student becomes seriously ill, is seriously injured in an accident or dies</li>
             <li>Terrorist Attack – If the U.S. Department of State states that there has been a terrorist attack against U.S. interests within the host country of a student’s program site, and issues an official Travel Warning that Americans should not travel to that city</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: For purposes of the CEASecure™ trip interruption coverage, immediate family of the student is defined as spouse, child, parent, legal guardian, sibling and grandparent. Refunds for medical reasons must be substantiated by a physician/hospital statement or other official medical documentation signed by a medical provider not related to the student. An officially published U.S. Department of State Travel Warning encompassing the dates and site for a student’s CEA program is required as documentation for a terrorist attack related refund.</p>
            <p><strong><span>Enrollment in CEASecure™</span></strong></p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Withdrawal Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>Any request by students for a pre-program start withdrawal refund must be made by sending a completed and signed CEASecure Withdrawal Notice form, available online, to the CEA Headquarters office in Tempe, Ariz. We must receive the form via fax, mail or email one calendar week before the start date for the program. We will send an acknowledgement email upon receipt of students’ CEASecure™ Withdrawal Notice.</p>
            <p>Pre-Departure Refund – All program fees paid up to the time of withdrawal will be refunded to the student minus the $95 application fee, the non-refundable program confirmation fee and the cost of CEASecure™. Late fees are not refundable under the plan. Withdrawal notices received after the deadline (one calendar week before the start date) will result in no refund.</p>
            <p><strong>Trip Interruption Refunds</strong></p>
            <p>Any request by students for a trip interruption refund must be made by sending a written notice to their CEA Program/Campus Director and CEA Headquarters in Arizona. CEA will send an acknowledgement email upon receipt of student notification.</p>
            <p>Program fee refunds, minus the application fee, the non-refundable confirmation fee and the cost of CEASecure™ for any of the above trip interruption benefits, will be pro-rated based on the portion of the CEA program that has been delivered up to the date of the covered event.</p>

All final payment due dates will be set no later than the withdrawal date. All students must be paid-in-full and/or have submitted the required Financial Aid forms by the withdrawal date. Any student wishing to withdraw from their program must express their intent to withdraw in writing prior to the withdrawal date. All withdrawal notifications must be received via fax, mail or email. Verbal notification will not be accepted. Once a withdrawal notification has been received, CEA will acknowledge receipt of notification by sending a withdrawal confirmation email to the student. Any student that has not submitted payment and/or valid Financial Aid Forms by their program withdrawal date may be withdrawn from their program for non-payment (please see Outstanding Balances section for more information). Refer to the Program Info tab on your MyCEA Account for your program’s specific withdrawal date.</p>
            <p>If the withdrawal date falls on a weekend, the following business day will be honored.</p>
            <p><strong>Refund Policies </strong></p>
            <p>When students are enrolled in a CEA study abroad program, they are automatically eligible for the Standard CEA Refund Policy at no extra cost above the study abroad application and program price. However, CEA recommends they enroll in the <strong>CEA<i>Secure</i>™ </strong>plan, which allows students to receive a refund for any one of the covered reasons described below up until one calendar week before their program start date. If they choose not to enroll in CEA<i>Secure</i>™, all refund requests must be sent to CEA’s Arizona Headquarters in writing on or before the program’s final withdrawal date to be eligible for a refund. All withdrawal requests must be sent via fax, mail or email. No verbal requests are accepted. We will acknowledge receipt of student requests by a Withdrawal Confirmation email. All refund decisions will be made by CEA staff.&nbsp;<span>Students who withdraw in writing on, or prior to, their program withdrawal date</span> are not responsible for final payment and may be entitled to a refund of payments already made to CEA, minus the application fee and program confirmation.</p>
            <p>No refunds will be given to students who withdraw from their program after the withdrawal date or to students who are withdrawn by CEA for non-payment. Likewise, students who withdraw after the program withdrawal date are still 100% responsible for final payment, regardless of participation. Any student that leaves a CEA program early after arriving on site will not be granted a refund.</p>
            <p>Students using Financial Aid or loans are responsible for their entire program cost if their Financial Aid or loans are rescinded after their program withdrawal date or if they choose to withdraw after their program withdrawal date (please see the Financial Aid and Outstanding Balances sections).</p>
            <p><strong>Special Situations: </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Academic Year Programs</strong>: Academic year students who wish to withdraw at the end of the fall semester/trimester are still subject to CEA's academic year pricing structure (see Program Price/Final Payment section). Academic year students should be aware of the withdrawal date for the winter and/or spring portion of their selected program. Notification in writing must be sent to the CEA Headquarters in Arizona, in addition to your CEA resident director (see Change of Program section). Students who have paid their AY program in full will receive a refund of the remaining 40% of the program price (spring portion) providing that their withdrawal notification is received prior to the spring semester withdrawal date. Any discount given will be forfeited.</p>
            <p><strong>Multiple Program Students</strong>: Multiple program students who have confirmed their participation on multiple programs and wish to withdraw from one or more sessions are subject to CEA's withdrawal and refund policies for the cost of their remaining programs. Multiple program students should be aware of the withdrawal date for the remaining programs. Written notification must be sent to the CEA Headquarters in Arizona in addition to your CEA Program/Campus Director (see Change of Program section). Any discount given is forfeited for the remaining sessions.</p>
            <p>With CEASecure™, students may withdraw from their CEA program for any covered reason up to one calendar week before the program’s start date and receive a full refund of program fees paid, minus the $95 application fee, the non-refundable program confirmation fee ($500 for semester and $300 for summer programs) and the cost of the CEASecure™ plan. Covered reasons are:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Medical – If a student or an immediate family member of the student becomes seriously ill, is seriously injured in an accident or dies</li>
             <li>Terrorist Attack – If the U.S. Department of State states that there has been a terrorist attack against U.S. interests within 25 miles of a student’s program site, and issues an official Travel Warning that Americans should not travel to that city</li>
             <li>Job Loss - If a parent or legal guardian of a student is laid off from work or loses his/her job as a result of a general staff reduction or position elimination</li>
             <li>Total Destruction of a Student's Primary Residence – If the student's primary place of residence is destroyed by a natural disaster, fire or explosion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your trip is interrupted after the start of your program, <strong>CEA<i>Secure</i></strong>™ provides limited refund coverage for your protection as follows:</p>
            <ul>

             <li>Total Destruction of a Student's Primary Residence – If the student's primary place of residence is destroyed by a natural disaster, fire or explosion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your trip is interrupted after the start of your program, <strong>CEA<i>Secure</i></strong>™ provides limited refund coverage for your protection as follows:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Note: For purposes of the CEASecure™ trip interruption coverage, immediate family of the student is defined as spouse, child, parent, legal guardian, sibling and grandparent. Refunds for medical reasons must be substantiated by a physician/hospital statement or other official medical documentation signed by a medical provider not related to the student. An officially published U.S. Department of State Travel Warning encompassing the dates and site for a student’s CEA program is required as documentation for a terrorist attack related refund.</p>
            <p><strong>Enrollment in CEASecure™</strong></p>

            <p><span data-contrast="none">After acceptance to the program, refunds in the event of withdrawal will be made according to the schedule below. Refunds will be calculated from the time SIT is notified by the student or by the last date of association with the program, whichever is later.

            <p>Penalties for withdrawal from a Spanish Studies Abroad program are assessed based upon the length of time between notice of your withdrawal and the start of the program. The deposit is always non-refundable. Withdrawal notification must be sent to <a href="mailto:info@spanishstudies.org">info@spanishstudies.org</a>.</p>
            <p>In addition to the deposit forfeiture, withdrawal from a Spanish Studies Abroad program incurs the following penalties:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>25% of program fee for withdrawals between final payment due date and 30 days prior to the start of the program.</li>
             <li>25% of the room and board fee and 100% of the tuition, study tours, general education, and orientation fees for withdrawals between 29 days prior to the start of the program and 1 day prior to program start.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is no refund for any portion of the program on or after the program start date.</p>
            <p>In the case of homestays, Spanish Studies Abroad may change unsatisfactory lodgings but will not refund any portion of room and board fees after a student’s arrival at a home. If the student finds his or her housing to be unsatisfactory, he or she should notify the program’s resident director or staff immediately.</p>

            <p>If it becomes necessary for the student to withdraw from the University, the student is expected to complete an official Leave of Absence/Withdrawal Form. This form is available from the Madrid Campus Registrar. Non-attendance does not constitute official withdrawal from the university or from a course(s). Financial liability will be based upon the date that the form is received by the Madrid Registrar.</p>
            <p>Before making a decision to withdraw or take a leave, students should be aware of the financial implications. In some cases, the student could be ineligible for financial aid that was scheduled to be received. Charges that were to be covered by financial aid would become the student's responsibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Late Withdrawal Fee</strong>: If the student chooses to withdraw 30 days or less before the start of courses, a $600 Late Withdraw Fee will be applied to the account.</p>
            <p><strong>Activity Fee: </strong>The Student Activities Fee is non-refundable 15 days or less prior to the first day of classes.</p>
            <p><strong>Course-related Fees: </strong><span>Course-related fees are 100% refundable if the student drops the course before the deadline for late registration.

                    <p>In order to determine a student's eligibility for refunds of any fees, Education Abroad must first receive written notice of withdrawal from the student either by a signed letter or email. Education Abroad cannot accept notice of withdrawal by any other means, including phone calls or letters from parents. The only exception to this would be if a student were incapacitated. In this case the student's parents or guardians should contact Education Abroad.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Program and Housing Deposits: </strong></em>The $200 program deposit and $200 housing deposit are non-refundable should a student withdraw from the program.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Housing Fees:</strong></em> Please note that Temple makes a commitment to housing partners abroad on behalf of students immediately after the due date of students' housing forms and deposits. If a student withdraws from the program or from Temple-arranged housing after the due date and before the start of the program, Temple will attempt to obtain a refund of the housing costs, but a refund may not be possible; students may be liable for the full costs of housing and will be billed accordingly. By the time students arrive on-site, Temple has made irrevocable commitments on their behalf. Students withdrawing from the program or leaving their Temple-arranged housing at or after the start of the program will receive no refund. If a student is responsible for damages or missing items, Temple University will bill the student for the outstanding amount.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Other Program Fees (where applicable): </em></strong>Once charges are posted to student accounts and initial bills are generated, Temple makes commitments on behalf of students for various activities and services covered by program fees (if any) such as orientation events, meals and excursions, if they are offered as part of the program (please refer to the program information on the Education Abroad website for details of any other program fees). If a student withdraws from the program before initial bills are issued (see <a href="https://studyabroad.acquiadev.temple.edu/billing-policies-and-procedures">Billing Policies and Procedures </a>for approximate initial billing dates), other program fees (if any) are refundable. After bills are issued, Temple will attempt to obtain a refund, but students need to be aware that a refund of program fees after the initial billing date may not be possible.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Tuition: </strong></em>With some exceptions (see * below) students may receive a full refund of tuition up to the end of the second week of classes provided the proper drop/add form and formal notice of withdrawal are completed and submitted in time. After this, refunds are not possible, though there is provision for petitioning for a refund of tuition after the end of the second week of classes if there are extenuating circumstances. For Temple's refund policy concerning tuition, please refer to the <a href="http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/tuition-fees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">undergraduate bulletin tuition section.</a></p>
                    <p>*Some of Temple’s programs involve partnerships with schools abroad. This information can be found on our website. For these programs Temple makes financial commitments on behalf of students to the partner institution; the amount of any tuition refund will depend upon what, if any, refund can be secured from the partner. If a student withdraws from the program before initial bills are generated, full tuition is refundable. If a student withdraws after bills are issued, Temple will attempt to obtain a refund, but a refund of tuition after the initial billing date is subject to the policies of our partners abroad.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Program cancellation:</em></strong>&nbsp; If a program is cancelled, program and housing deposits will be credited to your Temple account for the next term. Temple students in their last term and non-Temple students will receive a refund check. We also encourage you to consider purchasing trip cancellation insurance, which is available through many travel agents and insurance companies.&nbsp; Keep in mind that policies vary, so you should check with the travel insurance providers to find out the specific expenses and reasons for trip cancellation they will cover.</p>

            <p>The University accepts no obligation to refund any fee or part or any fee, paid in respect of any program. However, in the following circumstances the University may consider a partial refund of the fee paid.</p>
            <ul>

            <p><strong>Washington Semester Program - American University Withdrawal Refund Policy</strong></p>
            <p>Refunds will be based on the published dates in the Washington Semester Program Academic Calendar and Catalog. The cancellation percentage is based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal:</p>
            <p><strong>Tuition</strong></p>
            <p>In the unfortunate event that a student must cancel his/her participation in the program, below are the cancellation dates:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>100 percent tuition refund for course drop/withdrawal through the second calendar week of classes</li>
             <li>50 percent tuition refund for course drop/withdrawal through the third calendar week of classes</li>
             <li>25 percent tuition refund for course drop/withdrawal through the fourth calendar week of classes</li>
             <li>No refunds&nbsp;– Course drop/withdrawal after the fourth calendar week of classes <strong><br> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: The calendar week for cancellation of tuition ends on Friday (adjustments are made for legal holidays that fall within the first four weeks of the semester). Students should check the Academic Calendar for specific dates for each semester.</p>
            <p><strong>Housing</strong> <br> Requests for cancellation of room charges must be initiated by the student in writing to Housing and Dining Programs by the withdrawal deadlines. The student then must request any applicable refund through Student Accounts. The cancellation percentage is based on the date of withdrawal. More information regarding policies and procedures for campus housing can be obtained at the <a href="http://www.american.edu/ocl/housing/index.cfm"><strong>Housing and Dining</strong></a> page by reviewing the Housing License Agreement. <br> Note: Academic dismissal will result in a prorated charge for the weeks the student resided in university housing. <strong><br> </strong><br> <strong>Meal Plan</strong></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Meal Plan charges and refunds for all meal plans are prorated and calculated on a daily basis, based on the time of enrollment and total dining days per semester — not by the number of meals used. The dining days charges and refunds are calculated by the type of meal plan a student is enrolled in, when they were enrolled in the meal plan, and when the meal plan was applied to a student's One Card.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:375,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
