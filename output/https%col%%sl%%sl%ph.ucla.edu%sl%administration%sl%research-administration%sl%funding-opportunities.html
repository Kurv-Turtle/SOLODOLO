                      <p><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) seeks to encourage applications that employ innovative research to identify mechanisms of influence and/or promote positive sustainable health behavior(s) in children and youth (birth to age 21). Applications to promote positive health behavior(s) should target social and cultural factors, including, but not limited to: schools, families, communities, population, food industry, age-appropriate learning tools and games, social media, social networking, technology and mass media. Topics to be addressed in this announcement include: effective, sustainable processes for influencing young people to make healthy behavior choices; identification of the appropriate stage of influence for learning sustainable lifelong health behaviors; the role of technology and new media in promoting healthy behavior; identification of factors that support healthy behavior development in vulnerable populations, identification of barriers to healthy behaviors; and, identification of mechanisms and mediators that are common to the development of a range of habitual health behaviors. Given the many factors involved in developing sustainable health behaviors, applications from multidisciplinary teams are strongly encouraged. The ultimate goal of this FOA is to promote research that identifies and enhances processes that promote sustainable positive behavior or changes social and cultural norms that influence health and future health behaviors.&nbsp;</p>

Because many cancer survivor populations will not experience recurrence but will die of comorbid diseases or may experience early effects of aging, inclusion of biomarkers of comorbid diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and of the aging process are also sought. Applications should use experimental designs (e.g., randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), fractional factorial designs), and will require transdisciplinary approaches that bring together behavioral intervention expertise, cancer biology, and other basic and clinical science disciplines relevant to the pathways being studied.</p>
