        <p>Buildings are currently open during business hours, 7 days a week, 7 a.m. - 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>LMU community members have 24/7 OneCard access to the Westchester campus.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">Air Filtration</h2> 
        <p><a id="air"></a><strong>HVAC Regular Maintenance Standards<br></strong>Facilities Management continuously ensures campus HVAC systems are performing optimally, per guidelines set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).</p>
        <p>HVAC systems are maintained according to ASHRAE Operations and Scheduling Guidelines for Existing Air Handling Units (AHU) during the pandemic. LMU adheres to a national standard code 180 set forth by ANSI (Approved American National Standards Institute), ASHRAE and ACCA (Air Conditioning Contractors of America). This outlines standard practice for inspection and maintenance of commercial building HVAC systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Current COVID-19 Pandemic Enhancements<br></strong>Since March 2020, HVAC filtration levels in all campus systems have been increased to maximum system capacity in all campus buildings. LMU has also increased the frequency of HVAC filter replacement by 100% as compared to pre-COVID levels.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In&nbsp;preparation for campus reopening, FM has taken the following measures to ensure that campus HVAC systems were completely evaluated and operationally adjusted:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Reviewed air distribution conditions of existing spaces, resolving any issues including but not limited to covered diffusers, blocked return air grilles, reduced supply diffusers/registers, and return exhaust grilles that create short cycling.</li>
         <li>Commissioned external professionals for assessment of airflow and review of overall system configuration.</li>
         <li>Reviewed and addressed any existing air quality issues, complaints, or deficiencies.</li>
         <li>Adjusted outside air dampers, to as high as 100% intake, to increase outside air exchange and return air ratios to enhance fresh air circulation.</li>
         <li>Improved central air filtration optimum levels via:</li>
         <ul>
          <li>sealing of edges in filter racks</li>
          <li>frequent replacement of all filters</li>
          <li>increased filter efficiency in all buildings by a minimum of 16% for large particles and 50% for small particles.</li>
         </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
         <li>Expanded scheduled air flow beyond normal business hours to increase the time period for air exchange.</li>
         <li>Performed general inspections of spaces to identify potential concerns for water leaks or mold growth that could negatively impact occupant health.</li>
         <li>Reviewed control sequences to ensure systems are operating according to ASHRAE specifications, maintaining required ventilation, temperature, and humidity conditions in occupied areas. Leveraged service contract with Siemens to ensure front end controls are working and functioning properly at all times.</li>
         <li>Performed modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in offices and other spaces.</li>
         <li>Replaced 3,000 HVAC filters across campus</li>
         <li>Disinfected all individual air supply and return registers in every space on campus prior to occupancy.</li>

        <p><strong>Where can I get information about LMU isolation or quarantine instructions?&nbsp;<br></strong>Please refer to the isolation instructions found <a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#isolation" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What should I do if a friend or family member notifies me that they are COVID positive after I have spent time with them?<br></strong>If you are a close contact to a positive case, get tested and contact <a href="mailto:COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu">COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu</a>&nbsp;or 310.568.6868.</p>
        <p><strong>What should I do if I receive a positive COVID test result?<br></strong>Individuals who receive a COVID positive test, regardless of vaccination status, should <a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#isolation" target="_blank">self-isolate</a> and contact the COVID Support Team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu">COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu</a>&nbsp;or 310.568.6868. The COVID Support Team will provide you with individualized instructions and support in addition to conducting a contact investigation.</p>
        <p><strong>What should I do if I have COVID symptoms or just don’t feel well?<br></strong>If you do not feel well and you are confident you have not been exposed to a positive COVID case in the last two weeks, please follow these <a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#illness">instructions</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>When may I return to campus in-person after having COVID-19?<br></strong>You may return to in-person instruction after completing L.A. Public Health's <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidisolation/">isolation guidelines</a> and once cleared by the COVID Support Team.</p>
        <p><strong>May I attend class or go to work if I am COVID positive?<br></strong>No. Anyone who tests positive must <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidisolation/">isolate</a> and may not leave their home or come to campus until cleared by the COVID Support Team (unless they are obtaining essential medical care).</p>
        <p><strong>When can students return to class after they test positive?<br></strong>The COVID Support Team will provide instructions about when they may return to campus.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to tell my professor and/or supervisor that I'm sick?&nbsp;<br></strong>You are responsible for communicating the reason for&nbsp;your absence to&nbsp;your instructors or supervisors, though&nbsp;you do not need to disclose the specifics of&nbsp;your health status.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What happens if a student doesn't notify their professor that they're sick?<br></strong>If a student does not directly communicate with their faculty, faculty should treat the absence as they would typically.</p>
        <p><strong>How does LMU clean affected areas, in the event of a positive case?<br></strong>Additional cleaning and sanitation measures will be implemented for locations used by individuals who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. Procedures include wiping all surfaces with a sanitizing disinfectant approved by the EPA to kill COVID-19 and/or use of electrostatic disinfection machines to sanitize all surfaces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How does LMU conduct contact tracing?<br></strong>The COVID Support Team handles contact investigation and communication with positive, symptomatic or exposed individuals. Contact tracing is conducted for every individual who is lab-confirmed COVID positive and has been on one of LMU's campuses during the period in which they were infectious.</p>
        <p><strong>What happens if there is a positive case?<br></strong>In the event of a positive case, the COVID Support Team immediately initiates a contact investigation, provides instructions for home isolation, and issues exposure notifications (and quarantine instructions as applicable) for those exposed.</p>
        <p><strong>Will I be notified if I was in contact with a positive case?<br></strong>You will be notified if you were identified by the positive case to have had close contact with them indoors while they were infectious. (For the definition of close contact, <a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#isolation" target="_blank">click here</a>.) Note that L.A. County Public Health no longer considers outdoor exposures as close contact.</p>
        <p><strong>Will I&nbsp;be able to know who I was in close contact with, who tested positive? <br></strong>In support of the individual's privacy and in alignment with contact tracing protocol and best practices, the name or other identifying information of the positive case will not be disclosed to the close contacts, their faculty, their supervisors or any other individual in accordance with FERPA requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>How does LMU tell the community about COVID positive cases and exposures?<br></strong>Anyone may track the current isolation count&nbsp;and the number of cases on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/dashboard/">LMU COVID-19 Dashboard</a>, which is updated daily.</p>
        <p><strong>Will anything be posted in the actual location where a&nbsp;confirmed case was found?<br></strong>Per Cal/OSHA requirements, a notice will be posted for 24 hours at the general location of the primary worksite of an employee who is lab-confirmed COVID-positive, while also maintaining that employee's confidentiality.</p>
        <p><strong>Will LMU notify the community in the case of a larger outbreak?<br></strong>Clusters are reported on the university's COVID-19 dashboard; a cluster is defined by L.A. County Public Health as at least 3 epidemiologically linked cases. Details about the individuals who are lab-confirmed COVID positive will not be disclosed. This measure is in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How does LMU coordinate contact tracing with L.A. County Department of Public Health?<br></strong>The COVID Support Team Leader will report all lab-confirmed positive cases and exposures the L.A. County Department of Public Health, Acute Communicable Disease Unit daily in accordance with the County's&nbsp;<a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/protocols/ExposureManagementPlan_HigherEd.pdf">Guidance for Exposure Management in Higher Education</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>How is the COVID Support Team notified of a positive case?<br></strong>The COVID Support Team is automatically notified of positive results from tests collected at the LMU or LLS Testing Centers. Individuals who are tested off campus are expected to contact the COVID Support Team as soon as they receive a positive result. The COVID Support Team is available 7 days a week from 9:00am - 5:00pm&nbsp; (9:00am - 2:00pm on university holidays), and may be reached at <a href="mailto:COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu">COVIDSupportTeam@lmu.edu</a> or 310.568.6868.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><a id="domestic"></a>Effective July 1, 2021, the travel suspension has been lifted on university-sponsored or grant-funded travel within the United States for faculty and staff who are&nbsp;<a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/fullyvaccinated/">fully vaccinated</a>&nbsp;with a World Health Organization approved vaccine. Domestic travel includes research trips, conferences, immersion trips, volunteer or work programs, service learning, fellowships, or professional development activities.</p>
        <p>Domestic travel by non-vaccinated employees with a university-approved medical or religious exemption are being considered on a case-by-case basis. To request an exemption, please complete the&nbsp;<a href="https://bus.lmu.edu/risk/programs/travel/"><strong>Travel Exception Request Form</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>Non-vaccinated faculty and staff must follow CDC protocol upon return from travel:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Receive a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral test</a>&nbsp;3-5 days after travel&nbsp;AND&nbsp;stay home and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel.</li>

         </ul>
         <li>If no test is taken, stay home and self-quarantine for 10 days after travel.</li>
         <li>Avoid being around people who are at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">increased risk for severe illness</a>&nbsp;for 14 days, regardless of testing status.</li>

       <div class="content"> 
        <h2 class="h3">Face Masks</h2> 
        <p><strong>Face masks are not required on campus*, regardless of vaccination status. However, they are <a href="/together/communitymessages/indoormaskingstronglyrecommendedoncampus/" target="_blank">strongly recommended</a> due to increased transmission rates in L.A. County.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>*Do I need to wear a mask while on campus?<br></strong>LMU continues to align our policies with L.A. County Department of Public Health requirements and guidance from regional, state, and federal public health authorities.&nbsp;As of June 2, 2022, face masks are required in indoor meetings, gatherings, and learning spaces with 10 or more individuals on all its campuses, due to a significant and sustained increase in COVID-19 positivity rates. Masks are also still required at Student Health Services, Student Psychological Services, and the LMU shuttles, per county and state guidelines for healthcare and public transportation settings. In other indoor settings, masks are strongly recommended but not required.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What type of mask should I wear?<br></strong>L.A. County Public Health recommends surgical masks, N95 and KN95 respirators. Bandanas and scarves are not recommended. You can view L.A. County Public Health's full face mask recommendations <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/COVIDMasks.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>May I wear a face shield instead?<br></strong>Face shields with drapes are permitted as a reasonable accommodation only. To submit a request to use a face shield, students should contact <a href="mailto:dss@lmu.edu">DSS</a> and faculty and staff <a href="mailto:hr@lmu.edu">should contact HR</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I request an N95 mask?<br></strong>Faculty or staff may request an N95 or clear mask by submitting <a href="https://lmu.wufoo.com/forms/lmu-employee-mask-request-form/">this form</a>. Starting Jan. 24, 2022 surgical masks will also be available to students, faculty, staff, and visitors throughout campus in Malone, VDA, University Hall, Campus Safety, Burns Rec Center, and WHH Library.&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><a id="faculty"></a>Classrooms</h4>
        <p><strong>Are cleaning supplies available for my classroom?<br></strong>Cleaning supplies will be provided either inside or just outside classrooms, for faculty and students who wish to use them. If your supply runs low, please notify your area's <a href="https://lmu.box.com/s/1gx8l652j65w1al73om08jdf86il23v2">COVID Safety Liaison</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Will we physically distance in classrooms? Can I ask that students physically distance themselves?<br></strong>Public health authorities are no longer requiring physical distancing in classrooms; therefore, they are set up for normal capacity. If you wish to physically distance in the classroom, at your discretion, you may ask your students to spread out. However, any furniture that is moved during a class must be returned to its prior location at the end of the class.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I eat or drink while teaching?<br></strong>Yes. Pursuant to current L.A. County Public Health guidelines, masks are no longer required indoors as of March 7, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Modality Options and Technology Support</h4>
        <p><strong>As a faculty member, if the need arises, how do I change the modality of a course from in-person to online?<br></strong>Courses are to be taught in the modality listed in PROWL. Changing a course's modality (e.g. in-person to online) may only be requested in extraordinary, rare circumstances. If required, the instructor of record should request a modality change by contacting the department chair, who will then submit to the dean's office for consideration and approval. If the reason for a change arises from a medical condition, the instructor should contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hr@lmu.edu" target="_blank">Human Resources</a> who will facilitate the reasonable accommodation process.</p>
        <p><strong>How should I prepare for a student needing to attend class remotely?<br></strong>You can find resources at the <a href="https://academics.lmu.edu/onlinelearning/">Online Learning page</a>. Should others in your class have been exposed to the positive case, they (and you, if included) will be contacted by the LMU COVID Support Team for contact tracing. Faculty are encouraged to maintain a seating chart to support possible contact tracing efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>Should I create a seating chart?&nbsp;<br></strong>Most learning spaces have flexible furniture, therefore there are no set layouts or each room. Based on your needs, seating charts can simply be made through&nbsp;<a href="https://templates.office.com/en-us/seating-charts-tm01018402" target="_blank">Powerpoint templates</a>, or other products. Please reach out to your Instructional Technologist for assistance.</p>
        <p><strong>Can faculty conduct office hours remotely?<br></strong>Yes, faculty may choose to conduct their office hours remotely using Zoom or other technology available to all students in their classes.</p>
        <p><strong>What are my options for using a microphone during class?<br></strong>All general purpose classrooms have microphones already installed, as well as a movable HD webcam with stereo mic, to enable <a href="https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/creativeservices/zoom/">Zoom</a> or <a href="https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/creativeservices/classroomcapture/">Classroom Capture</a> (Echo360) recording. Additional equipment is available for specific needs. Please visit your classroom(s) and reach out to your Instructional Technologist to discuss needs. You can also read more <a href="https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/classroomsupport/microphonesfortheclassrooms/#d.en.407868" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What are my support options for producing class content?<br></strong>Thanks to generous funding from the Fletcher Jones Foundation and the Bill Hannon Foundation, this fall saw the opening of the Creative Services Studio in University Hall 3218. Three all-in-one recording studios&nbsp;are fully supported by a live service staff, and help faculty record lectures, demonstrations, podcasts, and instructional material. All content is edited live, so faculty post-production work is minimized. For more information, visit <a href="https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/creativeservices/">LMU ITS Creative Services</a></p>
        <p><strong>Are outdoor spaces available to reserve for course instruction?<br></strong>Instructors are welcome to use outdoor spaces for instruction. Please note: there are no reservations or support for outdoor space -- faculty may take their class outside and find an area suitable for instruction. Before moving outside, please consider if the space is accessible to all students, allows all students to participate in the pedagogy utilized, and whether the environment is conducive to teaching the class.</p>
        <p><strong>Are field trips and other off-campus trips permitted?<br></strong>Field trips and off-campus engagements associated with courses are currently allowed pursuant to LACDPH health and safety guidelines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Faculty Illness &amp; COVID Protocols</h4>
        <p><strong>What are my teaching options should I become ill?<br></strong>Instructors who are unable to access campus because of illness should notify their department chair to discuss coverage for their classes. Short-term options (up to two weeks) include the use of Zoom or asynchronous modalities. Longer-term illness or serious impairments may require arrangements for substitute instructors. Any employee accommodations due to illness should be reported to <a href="mailto:hr@lmu.edu" target="_blank">Human Resources</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Student Illness &amp; COVID Protocols</h4>
        <p><strong>What should I do if a student reveals to me that they have COVID?&nbsp;<br></strong>Instruct your student to contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/covidsupportteam/" target="_blank">COVID Support Team</a> immediately if they have not already done so, for resources and support. It is mandatory that they report their positive case to LMU, for contact tracing purposes. Please do not share your student's positive case with anyone else, to protect their privacy per FERPA.</p>
        <p><strong>What should I do if a student tells me they're sick?&nbsp;<br></strong>If a student feels ill (but not necessarily COVID-related symptoms), remind them to stay home and not return to campus (or leave their on-campus residence) until their symptoms have subsided and they are fever free for 24 hours without the use of medication. Students are encouraged to contact&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaffairs.lmu.edu/wellness/studenthealthservices/" target="_blank">Student Health Services</a> or their medical provider for an evaluation of symptoms. If they have COVID symptoms, they should make an&nbsp;appointment&nbsp;to get tested at the on-campus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/on-campuscovid-19testingcenter/" target="_blank">COVID Testing Center</a> (or off-campus with their medical provider or an L.A. County site, if they prefer).</p>
        <p><strong>Will I be notified if a student of mine tests positive for COVID?<br></strong>Students are responsible for notifying their professors as they would for&nbsp;any absence, COVID or otherwise. LMU will not notify faculty on the student's behalf, as this is a violation of FERPA privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Am I allowed to request documentation of a COVID positive test or isolation/quarantine?<br></strong>No, you cannot require specific proof of a COVID test or close contact. Your student may choose to provide it, but you cannot ask a student to waive their FERPA rights. If a student misses an exam or a number of class days, please submit the student's name to Community of Care to help LMU support you and your student.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Can I require a student to show a negative test before returning to my class after a suspected or confirmed COVID case?&nbsp;<br></strong>No. Any individual who has&nbsp;recently had COVID, as confirmed by a lab-based PCR test, will likely test positive for the following 90 days.&nbsp;As such, any resulting test is most likely inaccurate during the proceeding 90 days and not reflective of an active infection. Requiring a negative test is not appropriate, and in violation of CDC and L.A. County Public Health guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Can I ask my students to still wear face masks while in class?<br></strong>No. As of March 7, 2022 face masks are no longer required in L.A. County. T<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">hroughout the pandemic, the university has aligned with public health guidance and&nbsp;will continue to do so -- LMU will not permit protocols to vary by colleges, school, departments, classroom, or office. The university asks that you&nbsp;</span></strong>respect and honor the personal choices of fellow community members, including those who decide to continue wearing masks and those who decide to stop wearing masks.&nbsp;</p>

         <p><strong>What should I do if I’m feeling sick?<br> </strong>If you&nbsp;<a tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exhibit&nbsp;</a><a tabindex="-1" title="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms of COVID-19</a> do not come to campus (or leave your on-campus residence)&nbsp;or attend in-person classes/meetings until you obtain a negative COVID-19 test, are fever-free for 24 hours, and your symptoms have improved without the use of medication. Follow these 4 steps:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Seek medical attention.</strong> Students may schedule a telehealth appointment or message with a Student Health Services provider via&nbsp;<a title="LMU MyHealth" href="https://myhealth.lmu.edu">myhealth.lmu.edu</a>. Staff and faculty should contact their medical provider.&nbsp;</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Get tested.</strong> COVID-19 tests are available free of charge to members of the LMU community. Schedule your appointment at&nbsp;<a href="https://lmu.edu/covidappointments">lmu.edu/covidappointments</a> and email <a href="mailto:COVIDTesting@lmu.edu">COVIDTesting@lmu.edu</a> to notify them of your appointment time and that you are symptomatic so they can make special arrangements.&nbsp;You are also welcome to take a PCR or antigen test through your medical provider, an L.A. County community test site, or other testing location. Due to reduced accuracy of antigen, rapid antigen, or rapid PCR tests, we recommend that you still take a PCR test even if have already received a rapid test.</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Stay&nbsp;home and&nbsp;isolate yourself.</strong> While you await your COVID test/results and even if you test negative - do not leave your residence or socialize with others until you are fever-free and symptoms have subsided for 24 hours. This includes going to class, work, and eating in the dining halls. Do your best to isolate away from your household members – avoid sharing a room and bathroom if at all possible. If you must enter common areas in your residence, wear a mask and stay at least 6 feet away from others.</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>After you seek medical care, <strong>if your doctor believes you have COVID-19 or you have received a positive COVID-19 test</strong>, please immediately <a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#isolation">isolate</a>, and contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/covidsupportteam/">LMU COVID Support Team</a>&nbsp;for further instructions and resources.</li>

        <ul>
         <li>COVID positive is defined as an individual who has a positive diagnostic swab or saliva viral test for COVID-19 or whose healthcare provider thinks they have COVID-19. Note: an individual who has had COVID-19 in the past 90 days will continue to test positive even when they are no longer infectious. If an individual who had COVID-19 in the last 90 days has a new positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 and is asymptomatic, they are not presumed to have COVID-19 and are instructed to talk with their doctor to obtain a diagnosis.&nbsp;<br><br>
          <ul class="list-bullet2"></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What happens if an individual has COVID?<br></strong>If an individual has COVID-19 – meaning they have tested positive for COVID-19 using a lab-based saliva or swab PCR test, they are symptomatic and tested positive using a rapid antigen or PCR test,&nbsp;or their healthcare provider otherwise diagnoses them as infectious COVID-19, regardless of their vaccination status, they are required to isolate.</p>
        <p>Note: If an individual has had COVID in the last 90 days, they are instructed by L.A. County Public Health and the CDC to avoid testing using for 90 days from symptom onset or the date their positive test was collected since they may continue to test positive even though they are not infectious. As such, those who have had COVID in the past 90 days and test positive during that 90-day period are exempt from isolation unless the individual is symptomatic or has been diagnosed with COVID by their physician. The COVID Support Team will work these individuals to provide individualized guidance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/homeisolationencov.pdf">Isolation Instructions</a> for those who have COVID-19:</strong></p>
        <ul>
         <li>Stay home and separate yourself from others in your household until your home isolation ends.</li>
         <li>Do not leave your residence except for essential medical care. When obtaining medical care, drive yourself, if possible. If you cannot drive yourself, keep as much distance as possible between you and the driver and others by sitting in the back seat, leaving the windows down, and wearing a mask. If you do not have a mask, wear a cloth face covering.</li>
         <li>If someone from outside your household is shopping for you, ask them to leave the food and other supplies at your door and pick them up after the person has left.</li>
         <li>On-campus residents are provided with a dedicated isolation space and support, coordinated by Student Housing.</li>
         <li>An individual is cleared from isolation: 
          <ul>
           <li>After day 10, provided you remain asymptomatic or your symptoms have improved and you are fever-free without the use of medication for at least 24 hours - OR –</li>
           <li>On day 6 or later, provided that you test negative via an antigen test on day 5 or later, you remain asymptomatic or your symptoms have improved and you are fever-free for at least 24 hours without medication, and you have received clearance from the COVID Support Team. If you are cleared prior to day 10, you are required to wear a medical grade mask indoors at all times and outdoors when around others through day 10. (Those who test positive on their antigen test on day 5 or later are automatically required to complete a 10 day isolation.)</li>

        <p><strong>May I ask a community member about their vaccination status?<br></strong>No, a community member’s vaccination status is a private matter and protected by HIPAA and FERPA. Asking an individual to disclose their vaccination status is not permitted.</p>
        <p><strong>How many students will be vaccinated by the start of classes?<br></strong>As of Aug. 30, 2021 100% of our students who access campus in the fall semester&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;fully vaccinated, have an approved medical or religious exemption, or&nbsp;are in the process of becoming fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p><strong>How many students are receiving exemptions?<br></strong>A small portion of our students were approved for medical and religious exemptions, less than 2.2% of all students.</p>
        <p><strong>Are vaccinations and testing required for those who are on campus?<br></strong>Evidence of vaccination (uploaded to Vax LMU) or an approved medical or religious exemption are required for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/communitymessages/protectthepridegetvaxxed/">students</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/communitymessages/vaccinationsrequiredforlmuandllsfacultyandstaff/">faculty, and staff</a>&nbsp;prior to entering our campuses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>When are the university’s vaccination requirements in effect?<br></strong>The university&nbsp;began enforcing vaccination requirements for faculty, staff and commuting students&nbsp;on Aug. 30, 2021. The university&nbsp;began enforcing vaccination requirements for resident students when they moved into university housing. Those with an approved medical or religious exemption must be tested twice per week at the on-campus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/on-campuscovid-19testingcenter/">Testing Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>What will happen to students who receive exemptions?<br></strong>Students who receive medical or religious vaccination exemptions are permitted to attend in-person classes, and must be tested twice weekly.</p>
        <p><strong>What will happen to students who fail to comply with vaccination or testing protocols?<br></strong>Students who fail to comply with vaccination or testing protocols are subject to sanctioning through the student judicial process. The university reserves the right to cancel their registration at any time for not adhering to these protocols.</p>
        <p><strong>How will I know if my students are noncompliant or are facing sanctions?<br></strong>Similar to vaccination status, student judicial or conduct information is private and protected under FERPA.</p>
        <p><strong>If I have a vaccination exemption and I am away from campus for an approved reason (e.g. sick, vacation, jury duty, etc), what do I need to do to remain in compliance with the testing center?<br></strong>If you are required to get tested and you are away from campus for at least three days of any given week (Sunday through Saturday), you must request to be temporarily excused from COVID testing to avoid being marked as non-compliant using <a href="https://lmu.tap.thinksmart.com/prod/Portal/ShowWorkFlow/Embed/86f97504-7656-4425-a6ff-df09ae70a72c">this form</a>.</p>
