Timpani auditions will include basic tuning, snare drum auditions will include basic rudiments, and mallet auditions will include scales. The two etudes or solo compositions performed should each have contrasting styles represented.&nbsp; Sight-reading on two instruments will be required. Drum-set performers should prepare two pieces in contrasting styles, sight-reading of basic swing and Latin/funk charts and performance of four/eight bars of time followed by four/eight bars of soloing in both swing and funk/Latin styles at a medium tempo will also be required. &nbsp; Non-western Instrumental/Vocal Students experienced in non-western music traditions may also audition and&nbsp;receive&nbsp;support for private lessons under the Emerson/Harris Program. For questions regarding this, please email Andy Wilds (awilds@mit.edu). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;">

                  <p><strong>EMERSON/HARRIS PROGRAM FOR PRIVATE STUDY</strong></p>
                  <p>Funded by the late Mr. Cherry L. Emerson, Jr. (SM, 1941) in response to an appeal from Associate Provost Ellen T. Harris (Class of 1949 Professor Emeritus of Music), the&nbsp;<strong>Emerson/Harris Program&nbsp;</strong>offers merit-based financial&nbsp;awards&nbsp;for private study in music to students of outstanding achievement on their instruments in classical, jazz or world music.&nbsp;Each academic year, the Emerson/Harris Program awards Scholarships and Fellowships to nearly fifty students who commit to a full year’s study and participate in the musical life of MIT. Private teacher selections, made in consultation with the music faculty, may include instructors from MIT staff and throughout Greater Boston.</p>
