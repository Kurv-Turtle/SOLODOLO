              <p>If you receive COVID-19 vaccination off campus, including your initial or primary vaccine series and booster shots, share your records as soon as possible. (Note that UW Health clinics and vaccines given by UW Health providers are considered off campus.) Wait until you have received either the single dose of a one-dose vaccine or both shots of a two-dose vaccine to share your record. You may share booster records immediately.</p>
              <p>If you received your booster at UHS, or you previously gave permission to UHS to access your Wisconsin Immunization Record and you received a booster in Wisconsin, you don’t need to take any further action to share your vaccine record.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you may <strong>upload your record directly to MyUHS</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
               <li><a href="https://myuhs.uhs.wisc.edu/login_dualauthentication.aspx">Log into MyUHS</a> using your NetID and password.</li>
               <li>Select “Enter my COVID-19 Vaccine information.”</li>
               <li>You will be prompted to upload a copy of your immunization record. This can be an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG) or a PDF. Attempting to upload other kinds of files will result in an error message. Accepted records include:</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <ul>
                 <li>The official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination card you receive at your vaccine site. It must contain two patient identifiers, such as name and date of birth; vaccine lot number; vaccine name (for example, Moderna, Pfizer or Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson); date of vaccination (there should be two dates for Moderna and Pfizer); clinic name (must be an official clinic name; if the clinic was a chain pharmacy, please include the store number). The example below shows these fields.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-9258" src="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/content/uploads/2021/03/vaccine-card-300x230.jpg" alt="A sample CDC vaccination card showing the five fields — noted above — that must be filled in." width="400" height="307" srcset="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/content/uploads/2021/03/vaccine-card-300x230.jpg 300w, https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/content/uploads/2021/03/vaccine-card.jpg 527w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></li>
                 <li>Your <a href="https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/clientSearch.do?language=en"> Wisconsin Immunization Registry vaccination record</a></li>
                 <li>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html"> state vaccination record</a> from outside Wisconsin</li>
                 <li>For vaccination outside the U.S., the most complete record you have available. UHS will recognize vaccines maintained on the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"> World Health Organization’s emergency use listing. </a></li>
                </ul></li>
               <li>You will also need to enter the date of your one-dose vaccine and the vaccine manufacturer, or the dates of your two-dose vaccine and vaccine manufacturer in the section labeled “Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine.”</li>
               <li>Click or tap “Done” when you are finished.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Allow up to five business days for the record to be reflected in your MyUHS account. It may take longer for booster shots to be reflected in your campus record. While the record is under review your Medical Clearance information will indicate “awaiting review.” Once it is approved, this field will say “satisfied.” You will receive an email from UHS when your record is approved.</p>
              <p>If you received your vaccination in Wisconsin, and cannot find the record in WIR, contact the WIR Help Desk at 608-266-9691 or email <a href="mailto:DHSWIRHelp@dhs.wisconsin.gov">DHSWIRHelp@dhs.wisconsin.gov</a>.</p><span class="updated-on">Last updated <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/i-was-vaccinated-off-campus-how-do-i-let-uhs-know/" rel="bookmark">1:54 PM, February 24, 2022</a></span>

             <div class="uw-accordion-panel-inner">
              <p>While we want to give other students information intended to protect themselves and others, it’s important to respect the medical privacy of those who become sick. Informing your class that someone has tested positive may reveal the identity of the student who is sick. Instructors should not do this. If a student wishes to inform the class, they may do so, though they are not required. You should not cancel class.</p>
              <p>Instead, please regularly remind your students of the following:</p>
              <ul>
               <li>They should continue to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/coronavirus-self-checker.html?s_cid=ccbot_004#cdc-chat-bot-open">monitor themselves for symptoms daily</a>. This is true regardless of whether someone in the class has tested positive since exposure can happen in many different settings, on and off campus.</li>
               <li>If they <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/should-i-attend-work-or-class-if-i-am-sick/">develop symptoms of COVID-19</a>, they should isolate themselves immediately and make an appointment to get tested.</li>
               <li>They may hear from a campus contact tracer if they are deemed a <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/what-is-a-close-contact/">close contact</a> of someone who has tested positive. However, while campus has a team conducting <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/how-is-contact-tracing-operating-this-fall-will-i-know-if-i-have-been-near-someone-who-tested-positive/">robust contact tracing</a>, it will not always be possible to identify all close contacts of someone who has tested positive.</li>
               <li>If they learn they are a close contact of someone who tested positive, whether from a contact tracer or from the individual, they should follow <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/ive-been-exposed-to-someone-with-covid-19-do-i-need-to-quarantine-and-for-how-long/">instructions for quarantine and/or testing</a>.</li>
               <li>Risk of exposure in classrooms is low given that more than 90 percent of on-campus students and employees are vaccinated and everyone is required to wear masks. Most people in our community are strongly protected from infection. There is no need to cancel class because a student has tested positive.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additionally, instructors should be flexible with and supportive of students who cannot attend class in-person due to illness or quarantine but every effort should be made to avoid a disruption of in-person instruction.

In general, especially as more people become eligible for vaccination due to health conditions, it is good etiquette to avoid asking people their vaccination status. Anyone who wants to share their vaccine status information with others is free to do so on their own terms, but there is no requirement to share this information with others with whom they work and/or report.</p><span class="updated-on">Last updated <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/is-it-okay-to-ask-someone-i-work-with-if-they-have-been-vaccinated/" rel="bookmark">2:24 PM, May 26, 2021</a></span>

             <div class="uw-accordion-panel-inner">
              <p>Breakthrough cases occur when a person who has been vaccinated against an illness contracts that illness.</p>
              <p>Breakthrough cases are not unique to the COVID-19 vaccine and are inevitable, given that no vaccine is 100 percent effective. COVID-19 vaccines remain highly effective and vaccinated individuals are far less likely than unvaccinated individuals to contract COVID-19.</p>
              <p>As more people are vaccinated, chances are greater that we will hear about more breakthrough infections. These cases still represent a very small fraction of the total number of people who are fully vaccinated.</p>
              <p>The purpose of a vaccine is to reduce both the chances of getting a disease and, among those who experience infection, to reduce the negative outcomes of the disease. In the case of COVID-19, the goals are as follows: 1) reduce transmission altogether and 2) if transmission does happen, limit the severity of symptoms and significantly reduce hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.</p>
              <p>The vaccines approved or authorized by the FDA accomplish these goals. Fully vaccinated people are much less likely than unvaccinated people to become sick with COVID-19 and are much less likely to experience severe illness and death.</p>
              <p>The CDC and FDA continue to monitor how well the vaccines protect vulnerable people from illness and have begun to recommend supplemental vaccination or booster shots for some people. This does not indicate vaccines are not effective. Immune responses to many different vaccines can wane with time and additional doses can help bolster that response and extend protection.</p>
              <p>Ensuring that anyone who is unvaccinated gets vaccinated as soon as possible is key to slowing transmission in the unvaccinated population and reducing the amount of virus circulating among all people, further reducing the chances anyone is exposed to the virus.</p><span class="updated-on">Last updated <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/what-is-a-covid-breakthrough-case-and-does-this-change-our-confidence-in-the-vaccines/" rel="bookmark">2:11 PM, January 7, 2022</a></span>

There are limited exceptions to this in certain types of jobs (such as health care roles) where sharing vaccine status information is required, but in these limited cases employees are formally notified of this requirement. In general, especially as more people become eligible for vaccination due to health conditions, it is important to avoid asking these types of questions of employees because it could cause an employee to feel compelled to share medical or disability information and this should be avoided.</p><span class="updated-on">Last updated <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/can-a-supervisor-or-manager-ask-an-employee-whether-they-have-been-vaccinated/" rel="bookmark">8:57 AM, August 6, 2021</a></span>
