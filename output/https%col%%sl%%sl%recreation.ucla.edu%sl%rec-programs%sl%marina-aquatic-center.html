          <h2> More Information </h2>
          <h3>About the MAC</h3>
          <p><strong>Our History:</strong></p>
          <p>The UCLA Marina Aquatic Center, formerly referred to as the “UCLA Boating and Safety Education Program,” was created in 1977 through a grant from the California Department of Navigation and Ocean Development for the purpose of providing boating safety and education at UCLA and in the Southern California area. For the first fourteen years of operation, the Marina Aquatic Center (MAC) operated instructional sailing and windsurfing programs as part of the University’s Department of Cultural and Recreational Activities (CRA). In 1991 the Department took over operation of the adjacent crew boathouse and subsequently added recreational rowing, kayaking, and surfing to its roster of activities. As part of a department wide expansion, the Center began offering youth boating in 1994, effectively exposing a new and important segment of the Southern California community to the concepts of water and boating safety. Due to the rapid rise in popularity of stand up paddling, and the Coast Guard's decision to regard SUP boards as vessels, the Marina Aquatic Center made the decision to add a Stand Up Paddling clinic to its schedule in 2011.</p>
          <p>Today the Marina Aquatic Center is a vibrant waterfront recreation facility offering equipment rentals and a multitude of inclusive boating and safety programs in sailing, rowing, windsurfing, kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, and surfing. The MAC also houses the UCLA Men's and Women's Rowing Teams, UCLA Sailing Team, MAC Junior Rowing Team, and youth boating programs.</p>

           <li>Sailors, kayakers, stand up paddle boarders (SUP), and windsurfers are required to wear Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) while on the dock and water, at all times. Rowers are exempt.</li>
           <li>To protect your feet, always wear shoes at the MAC.&nbsp; Shoes should have sufficient tread and heal&nbsp;Support&nbsp;to prevent you from slipping on the wet surfaces around the dock.&nbsp; Bare feet are only allowed on the dock as you are launching or docking rowing shells, stand up paddleboards, windsurfers, kayaks, or laser sailboats.&nbsp; Shoes should be replaced first thing after docking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>When launching and docking, minimize the time you spend on the dock and the space that you take up to help reduce dock congestion.</li>
           <li>Participants must be able to “self-rescue.” If you are unable to self-rescue due to an injury or equipment breakage, stay with the vessel. Do not try to swim to shore.&nbsp; Hail the Dockmaster or other boaters for assistance.</li>
           <li>Participants must be able to steer a safe course through the marina, keeping watch for obstacles.</li>
           <li>During a rental, it not permitted to beach equipment, dock at another location, or to leave the vessel unattended at any time.</li>

            <ul>
             <li>When two vessels collide for any reason, whether they sustain damage or not.</li>
             <li>A MAC vessel hits or becomes stuck in rocks, mud, or any other stationary object.</li>
            </ul></li>

          </ul>
          <h4>EQUIPMENT CARE</h4>
          <ul>
           <li>Renters will be responsible financially for equipment that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear. If the damage is excessive, they may be responsible for full repair/replacement costs ($90/hr on repair labor).

           <li>Secure accessories and equipment before launching.</li>
           <li>Never drag the equipment on the ground.</li>
           <li>When you return to the dock, bring your equipment back into the staging zone that was assigned at the start of your rental. Thoroughly rinse your vessel with fresh water.</li>
           <li>Return lifejackets to designated area to be sanitized by a staff member.</li>
           <li>Do not use any tools&nbsp;or other&nbsp;Supplies&nbsp;owned by the Marina Aquatic Center.&nbsp; Do not attempt to fix or customize any equipment while in your use.&nbsp; See your instructor or the&nbsp;Dockmaster&nbsp;on duty if you need help with equipment.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>MARINA DEL REY TRAFFIC PATTERN</h4>
          <ul>
           <li>It is the general responsibility of all vessels to avoid collision. Care should be taken to give these vessels the space and opportunity to maneuver.</li>
           <li>Follow all standard COLREGs for navigation.</li>
           <li>Yield to incoming traffic as you leave the dock and maneuver through the inbound power channel.</li>
           <li>Launch and dock with traffic flow.</li>
           <li>The traffic in the Marina follows a counter clockwise pattern around buoys in the Main Channel and counter clockwise around center line of the Entrance Channel.</li>
           <li>Do not stop your vessel in an area where you will impede others.&nbsp; Yield to faster vessels.</li>
           <li>Do not block traffic.&nbsp; If you must stop to receive instruction, or adjust equipment, position your vessel out of the main traffic flow.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>WIND AND WEATHER</h4>
          <ul>
           <li>Participants may only rent within the wind parameters and designated areas as outlined in the table below. MAC staff reserve the right to determine when rentals and water activities are safe. Decisions will be based on the weather guidelines presented below, but staff may still choose to restrict activity even if the listed thresholds have not been reached.</li>

           <li>When lifting boats always communicate with your partner.</li>
