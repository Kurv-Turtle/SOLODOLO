Those departments are represented here. \n\nAcademy of Creative Media\nAs Hawaiʻi’s only film school, the Academy for Creative Media (ACM) is at the forefront of cinematic arts in the Pacific. Located in Honolulu at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, ACM is dedicated to academic and creative excellence through its Bachelor of Arts degree designed to encourage innovation and collaboration with emphasis on Hawaiʻi, the Pacific and Asia. Focused in the heart of a state with a robust film and television industry, ACM encourages professional development, mentorship, and community engagement through a variety of programs including internships, master classes, and industry screenings such as the Hawaiʻi International Film Festival.\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nACM nurtures and empowers students to develop their own unique voices as storytellers, exploring creative media forms rooted in personal experience and place-based learning through animation, critical studies, digital cinema, and screenwriting.\n\nThe Department of Theatre (THEA) and Dance (DNCE) is comprised of two separate but related disciplines.\nTheatre includes the study of dramatic literature and theory; acting and directing; stage, costume, and lighting design; stagecraft; playwriting; Asian theatre, Hawaiian theatre, and TYA (Theatre for Young Audiences); and performance studies. Imaginative and creative individuals interested in the disciplined, practical application of classroom theory are suitable candidates as theatre majors. Teaching and professional stage, film, and television work are typical professions of theatre majors, but the analytical and practical skills, discipline and self-confidence, creativity, problem solving, and ability to work toward common production goals are applicable to a wide variety of industries and professions. Other fields known to actively recruit employees with a theatre degree include: advertising, animation, architecture, arts administration, business administration, design for public spaces, fashion, graphic design, human-computer interface design (HCI), landscaping, multi-media marketing, non-profit management, public relations, themed entertainment, urban design and planning, and video game design and performance. The theatre major benefits from a comprehensive curriculum that includes a pioneering Hawaiian theatre program, a nationally respected TYA program, and an internationally recognized program focusing on the Asian theatre traditions of China, Japan, South and Southeast Asia.\nDance is the art of human motion. It encompasses the study of human movement as it relates to the physical sciences, music, theatre performance and production, history, cultural context, education, technology, visual design, and human expression. Dance majors find careers in the areas of performance, choreography, teaching, arts administration, production, television and film history and criticism, and research. UH Mânoa’s dance program offers comprehensive theory courses and a wide variety of dance techniques and styles. The program is considered unique with its offerings in dance culture and performance studies and Asian and Pacific dance.\n\nThe UH Choirs\nWith three choirs in our program, there is an ensemble for you! \u2028All are welcome, regardless of your major! \u2028Members can participate in person or via distance next semester! \nChamber Singers\n MUS 410C\u2028 MWF, 1:30–2:20pm\nChamber Singers is the premiere choral ensemble for the University of Hawaiʻi System.
