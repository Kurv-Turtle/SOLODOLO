       <p>In 2015, a group of graduate students at the University of California, Davis attended a hearing on California's Healthy Soils Initiative. They witnessed firsthand the power of storytelling to captivate an audience, as well as the challenges of communicating uncertainty and nuance regarding the dynamic nature of soil.</p> 
       <p>They started a seminar to discuss and develop science communication, which evolved into a campaign to raise awareness about the value and importance of soil, which caught the attention of the Natural Resource Conservation Service, and ultimately led to a collaboration to produce educational resources (links below).</p> 
       <p>Their mission is:</p> 
       <ol> 
        <li>To inspire the next generation of soil explorers for the benefit of all</li> 
        <li>To educate that soils are living bodies that harbor a diversity of life, and support and sustain life as we know it</li> 
        <li>To empower young power with solutions to some of our greatest global challenges; solutions that lie right beneath our feet!</li> 
       </ol> 
       <p>After years of work, the <a href="https://soillife.org/">Soil Life website </a>has officially launched.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>The site includes&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>1) An interactive, graphics-based introduction to soil science;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>2) A media hub of soils-related content, and&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>3) Clear, actionable ways for people to 'get involved' protecting and promoting soils in their everyday lives.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>They have also launched the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIW-aYHE60k&amp;t=34s">video</a> in a 6-part series highlighting the connection between soil and life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Check out their <a href="https://soillife.org/">website</a>,</p> 
       <p>Watch "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIW-aYHE60k&amp;t=34s">The Story of Soil and Food</a>," and&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Share with your networks (especially the educators and young people in your lives!)&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>The website and videos were produced under a UC Davis/USDA-NRCS collaborative project and are part of a national campaign to raise awareness about the value and importance of soil.&nbsp;</p>

In this study, a web-based <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about soil salinity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-salinity">soil salinity</a> leaching management model (SALEACH) was developed as an online tool to assist growers for better and easier management of <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about soil salinity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-salinity">soil salinity</a> to sustain agricultural production in irrigated croplands.

The SALEACH model can calculate the required irrigation water depth by using the estimated LR or any user-specified leaching fraction (LF) values; it can predict the drainage water salinity and soil salinity in the rootzone based on the applied leaching; and it can estimate relative crop yield for a given LF. SALEACH-estimated LRs were assessed in different soil types and irrigation systems by comparing them with LRs, <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about soil water from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-water">soil water</a> and drainage water salinity values obtained from an existing steady-state model (WATSUIT) and a transient-state model (HYDRUS-1D). Statistical analyses showed that SALEACH-estimated LRs, soil salinity, and drainage water salinity were all in the acceptable ranges of the corresponding values derived from other models. Thus, we conclude SALEACH is reliable and can be employed by practitioners to produce satisfactory estimations of LRs and soil salinity by considering the soil, crop, water quality, and <a class="topic-link" title="Learn more about irrigation system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/irrigation-system">irrigation system</a>.

      <div class="posttext"> 
       <p>If you can sell your cowpeas, fava beans and barley, you can make money in Spain and apparently not use any more water than if just growing the mandarins. And coastal growers should look at the fresh market.&nbsp; Have you ever tasted a fresh green cowpea or fava bean?&nbsp; Pretty darn good and consumers think so, as well.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Diverfarming project study compares the environmental footprint and the economic performance of traditional mandarin monocropping as opposed to growing mandarin intercropped with herbaceous crops and the use of deficit irrigation</strong></p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">The transformation towards intensive agriculture has led to agricultural practices in Europe that have centred on increasing the yield and reducing costs in recent decades, and which involve a major dependence on external sources of agrochemicals and energy. These intensive monocropping systems have generated biodiversity losses, water contamination, and high rates of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as degrading the soil and reducing the ecosystem services.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">Faced with this situation, the European Diverfarming project has trialled the diversification of crops throughout the European Union, seeking the best practices to combine crops and focusing on reducing inputs to find the best options to preserve the sustainability of the systems and increase the resilience of the European agricultural sector. To do so, it is also necessary to know the impacts of these practices both at environmental as well as economic level.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">With the aim of knowing the environmental footprint and the economic performance of the introduction of herbaceous crops among the alleys of the mandarin trees using controlled deficit irrigation in a mandarin grove located in the Region of Murcia, a team of researchers from the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena have carried out a life-cycle assessment of the crop and an evaluation of the costs and income of the farm for the three years that the experiment in this case study was carried out.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">Although the growing area increased with the introduction of the herbaceous crops (in this case purslane, cowpea, broad beans, and a barley-vetch mix), no detrimental effects occurred in terms of exhausting resources, acidification, or global warming. Therefore, the practice of intercropping did not cause additional contamination or other environmental impacts. This, in addition to the results of the increase in nitrogen and organic carbon content and in the soil and the reduction in erosion and run-off makes the introduction of herbaceous crops in the alleys of the mandarin trees a good sustainable environmental option to cope with the current challenges of the sector.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">In economic terms, the financial security of the agricultural community also becomes a key element for successfully adopting diversified systems. This study highlights, through the economic assessment, that intercropping can lead to an increase in production costs, mostly related with a greater demand for labour in comparison with monocropping. However, the study also concludes that “the correct choice of intercropping practices can bring economic advantages”. The results showed that the mandarin crop with purslane and broad beans as intercrops could be profitable and reduce the risk for the grower against volatile prices in the main crop.</p> 
       <p style="text-align: justify;">In this way, considering all the potential environmental and economic benefits of intercropping practices, these systems arise as a tool to move towards more sustainable and profitable agricultural systems. The valorisation of agricultural products that are more respectful to the environment on the part of consumers and the backing of public funding (e.g., direct help to growers who introduce intercropping) are key aspects to drive the adoption of these practices.</p>

        <p>Citrus mealybug has been increasing issue in the San Joaquin Valley in last 3 years. It has been reported from Kern, Fresno, Tulare, and Madera counties in the past years. It&nbsp;is a hemipteran pest that feeds on plant sap, reducing tree vigor and affects yield. Mealybug excrete honeydew which gets on leaf and fruit surfaces where sooty mold grows.</p> 
        <p>Mealybugs are soft, oval flat, distinctly segmented insects covered with white mealy wax, giving it a dusted in flour appearance. Females lay eggs in egg sacs loosely held by white cottony flint. Crawlers when hatched are yellowish in color but soon develop waxy covering once they start feeding. Adult females are 3-5 mm long, wingless, with pinkinsh body covered in white mealy wax. Males are winged and take a longer time to develop then females.&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Although seasonal phenology of citrus mealybug in the San Joaquin Valley is not well understood, we found actively producing live female populations (with some egg hatch) in first week January. This means that it is just not cold enough for these insects to trigger their overwintering habits. Mealybugs&nbsp;are know to have multiple overlapping generations per year. Females cannot fly and are dispersed either by crawling between trees, assisted transport by ants, birds, wind, machinery or labor.</p> 
        <p>With the weather warming up, this is a great time to start checking your orchards, especially if you had mealybug infestation last year. Sampling studies that we initiated this week (February 9, first sampling date) already showed crawler activity.</p> 
        <p><strong>Where to look for crawlers and first instars</strong><strong>?</strong></p> 
        <p>When eggs first hatch, the crawlers are yellowish in color and found around areas where egg sac is. They soon start feeding and develop a dusty white mealy wax covering. Crawlers usually disperse to neighboring&nbsp;leaves and start feeding and are commonly found along the midrib.&nbsp;</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>If you still have fruit on the tree, check the fruit. Mealybug likes clusters, check for any signs of mealybug infestation. Eggs can be present on navel end or the areas where fruit is touching, or where the fruit is joined to the twig.</li> 
         <li>On leaves with signs of sooty mold - usually found in inside canopy of the tree.</li> 
         <li>Between twigs inside canopy of the tree</li> 
        </ul>

        </div> Celebrated honey bee authority <a href="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=26122">Dr. Eric Carnes Mussen</a>, an internationally known 38-year California Cooperative Extension apiculturist and an invaluable member of the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology faculty, died Friday, June 3 from liver cancer. He was 78. 
        <br> 
        <p>Dr. Mussen, a resident of Davis, was admitted to a local hospital on May 25. He was diagnosed with liver cancer/failure on May 31 and returned to the family home June 1 for hospice care. He passed away the evening of June 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“Eric was a giant in the field of&nbsp;apiculture,” said <strong>Steve&nbsp;Nadler,</strong> professor and chair of the UC Davis Department of Entomology and&nbsp;Nematology. “The impact of his work stretched far beyond California.”&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Dr. Mussen, known to all as “Eric,” joined the UC Davis entomology department in 1976. Although he retired in 2014, he continued his many activities until a few weeks prior to his death. For nearly four decades, he drew praise as “the honey bee guru,” “the pulse of the bee industry" and as "the go-to person" when consumers, scientists, researchers, students, and the news media sought answers about honey&nbsp;bees.&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“Eric's passing is a huge loss," said longtime&nbsp;colleague <strong>Lynn&nbsp;Kimsey</strong>, director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://bohart.ucdavis.edu">Bohart&nbsp;Museum of Entomology</a> and a UC Davis distinguished professor of entomology. "He was always the go-to person for all things honey bee. He worked happily with hobbyists, commercial beekeepers and anyone just generally interested."</p> 
        <p>Colleagues described Mussen as&nbsp;the “premier authority on bees and pollination in California, and one of the top beekeeping authorities nationwide,”&nbsp; “a treasure to the beekeeping industry," and "a walking&nbsp;encyclopedia&nbsp;when it comes to honey bees.”</p>

        </div> <strong>Norman Gary</strong>, a noted UC Davis emeritus professor of entomology who served as a faculty member from 1962 to 1994, described Eric as “by far, the best Extensionapiculturist in this country.”&nbsp; 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“Eric's career was so productive and exciting that a book would be required to do justice for his many contributions to his profession as extension entomologist specializing in apiculture, better known as beekeeping,” Gary said. “His mission basically was facilitating productive and reciprocal communication between beekeeping researchers at UC Davis, commercial beekeeping as it affects California's vast needs for the pollination of agricultural crops, providing helpful information to hobby beekeepers, and educating the general public concerning honey bees.&nbsp; His great professional successes in all areas have been recognized around the world.&nbsp; He has received numerous awards, especially from the beekeeping industry. &nbsp;He was by far the best Extension apiculturist in this country!”&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“In addition to professional duties, he enthusiastically tackled other projects for entomology faculty,” Gary said. “For example, he critically reviewed most of my publications, including scientific papers, books, and bulletins.&nbsp; He worked diligently to help create the Western Apicultural Society and later served as president. (Mussen served six terms as president, the last term in 2017.) &nbsp;I especially appreciated his volunteering to moderate a video that historically summarized and recorded my entire 32-year career at UC Davis.&nbsp; And his tribute would not be complete without mentioning that he was one of my favorite fishing buddies.”&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“Eric was proud of his loving wife, Helen, and family (sons Timothy and Christopher&nbsp;and two grandchildren),” Gary said. “His family support was unconditional. &nbsp;He will be sadly missed by everyone.”&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>Leslie Saul-Gershenz</strong>, a UC Davis doctoral alumnus in entomology, praised his kindness and generosity. “I have known Eric for over 30 years and he was the kindest, most supportive human being. &nbsp;He always came to speak at the San Francisco Bee Club to support local beekeepers and was the most generous of colleagues anyone could ever hope for. He was a immense resource of knowledge about honey bees, and I am sure he will be missed by many people across the state of California.”</p>

        </div> “Despite his illness, which I was unaware of, he helped me with a honey bee issue just a couple of weeks ago," said <strong>Catherine&nbsp;Tauber</strong>, a UC Davis Department of Entomology and&nbsp;Nematology&nbsp;associate and a retired Cornell University senior research associate. "He even wrote to the person he thought could help out and ‘greased the skids' for me. A truly unselfish, helpful, and thoughtful person. The department and California bee enthusiasts lost a true friend.” 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Mussen's&nbsp;longtime friends and colleagues--bee breeder-geneticist <strong>Susan Cobey</strong> of Washington State University (WSU), a former manager of the Harry H.&nbsp;Laidlaw Jr. Honey Bee Facility, UC Davis, and her husband, <strong>Timothy Lawrence</strong>, WSU&nbsp;associate professor and county director,&nbsp;WSU&nbsp;Extension, Island County--are heartbroken. “Eric is an icon of the beekeeping industry and beyond,&nbsp; a career shaper, problem solver, the information man who always had an answer or would find one, and, always given with integrity, regardless of the issue, biological or political, to whoever posed the question and need," Cobey&nbsp;said. "His contributions, impact and love from the people he touched will live, continuing to contribute and benefit their lives. His spirit is with us.”&nbsp;</p>

        </div> &nbsp;“As an Extension professional, Eric set the standard that I tried to emulate," said Lawrence. "We had very different approaches but our goals were similar: &nbsp;give people the information they need to make the best decision, based on the current body of scientific knowledge for their given circumstances. Instead of telling folks how to do something, he would listen and guide them on the science and let them make the decisions (and mistakes) on their own. He did this with Sue and me, and we greatly benefited from hismentorship. I observed him apply this approach from hobbyists to large-scale professional beekeepers. He was thepreeminent Extension Professional.”&nbsp; 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>Jackie Park-Burris</strong> of Jackie Park-Burris Queens, Inc., Palo Cedro, a leader in the queen bee breeding&nbsp;and beekeeping industries, said she met Eric more than 40 years ago “and from day one he was mentoring me. He was the bee guy for the entire country!&nbsp; Eric was the bee industry's connection to the scientific world. Eric understood both camps and he connected them. Eric had incredible integrity that I have never seen matched. Because of that integrity, beekeepers felt confident in sharing their problems with him, knowing their secrets were safe. Eric always voiced the opinion he felt was right, even if it wasn't the most popular.”<br> <br> “Eric told me that he looked at the bee industry as his family,” said Park-Burris, a past president of CBSA and a member of the board of directors for more than 20 years. “When my son attended UC Davis, he and Helen made sure Ryan knew he could contact them if he needed anything. Eric even came to a function on campus that my son was in charge of to show support.”&nbsp;</p>

        </div> &nbsp;“Eric supported the California State Beekeepers Association and the California Bee Breeders wholeheartedly!” said Park-Burris, who served as the first woman president of the California Bee Breeders Association and the first woman chair of the California State Apiary Board. “He did an incredible job as our Extension guy from UC Davis. We loved him. What a sad loss for us all.”&nbsp; 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“At last year's CSBA convention. I was awarded the Eric Mussen Distinguished Service Award. Eric sent me an email, congratulating me and told me he could not think of a more qualified person to receive it. It bought a tear to my eye back then, now I will treasure that email even more.”&nbsp; A photo of an early-career Mussen&nbsp;appears on her <a href="https://jackieparkburrisqueens.com/about-jackie.html">website</a>.</p> 
        <p><strong>Patrick “Pat” Heitkam</strong>, owner of Heitkam's Honey Bees, Orland, recalled the beekeeping industry's turbulent times in the 1980s.&nbsp; “He was many things and I'm certain no one will fill his position as admirably as he did. The mid-'80s were a turbulent time for commercial beekeepers in California. The advent of tracheal mites and later varroa disrupted our ability to make a living. We were affected in different ways. Passions ran high. Eric maintained the respect of all concerned. I was frustrated, more than once, because he wouldn't tell me what I wanted to hear. He was a scientist, stayed neutral, and only commented when he could be factual. I saw him as the level-headed patriarch of his dysfunctional beekeeping family. This is one of his many attributes. I can't say enough about his value to bee world.”</p> 
        <p>Born May 12, 1944 in Schenectady, N.Y.,&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;received his bachelor's degree in entomology from the University of Massachusetts (after declining an offer to play football at Harvard) and then obtained his master's degree and doctorate in entomology from the University of Minnesota in 1969 and 1975, respectively.&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;credits his grandfather with sparking his interest in insects. His grandfather, a self-taught naturalist, would take his young grandson to the woods to point out flora and fauna.</p> 
        <p>Bees became his life, and&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyed his career.&nbsp;For nearly four decades,&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;wrote and published the bimonthly newsletter,&nbsp;<em>from the UC Apiaries</em>, and short, topical articles called&nbsp;<em>Bee Briefs</em>, providing&nbsp;beekeepers with practical information on all aspects of beekeeping.&nbsp; His research focused on managing honey bees and wild bees for maximum field production, while minimizing pesticide damage to pollinator populations.</p> 
        <p>During his tenure as the state's Extension&nbsp;apiculturist,&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;traveled to beekeeping clubs throughout California, addressing some 20 beekeeping organizations a year. For 10 years, he also conducted the California State 4-H Bee Essay Contest, disseminating guidelines, collecting entries and chairing the judging.</p> 
        <p>A favorite among the news media for his bee expertise and personality,&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;appeared on the&nbsp;<em>Lehrer&nbsp;Hour,&nbsp;BBC, Good Morning America</em>, National Public Radio (<em>Science Friday</em>) and other major news outlets, and was quoted by the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Boston Globe,</em>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Los&nbsp;Angeles&nbsp;Times</em>,&nbsp;among others.</p> 
        <p>Highly honored by his peers, Mussen received the&nbsp;2006 California Beekeeper of the Year award; the American Association of Professional&nbsp;Apiculturists' 2007 Award of Excellence in Extension&nbsp;Apiculture; the 2008 Distinguished Achievement Award in Extension from the Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America; the 2010&nbsp;statewide&nbsp;Pedro&nbsp;Ilic&nbsp;Outstanding Agricultural Educator; and was a member of the UC Davis Bee Team that won the 2013 team award from the Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>Gene Brandi,</strong> the 2018 president of the&nbsp;American Beekeeping Federation,&nbsp; remembers presenting him with the prestigious Founders' Award from the&nbsp;Foundation for the Preservation of Honey Bees at the 75th annual&nbsp;American Beekeeping Federation&nbsp;conference in Reno. "Eric received a well-deserved rousing standing ovation!” said Brandi, extolling him as "an outstanding liaison between the academic world of&nbsp;apiculture&nbsp;and real-world beekeeping and crop pollination."</p> 
        <p>When Mussen was nominated (and received) the 2013-14 Distinguished Service Award for Outstanding Extension from the UC Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR), MacArthur Genus Awardee Professor <strong>Marla Spivak</strong>, Distinguished McKnight University Professor Apiculture/Social&nbsp;Insects at the University of Minnesota, wrote:&nbsp; "Without question, Eric is the No. 1 Extension person dealing with honey&nbsp;bees in the nation, if not the world. Research colleagues, beekeepers and the public are all very lucky to have him.”&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Wrote Extension Specialist <strong>John Skinner</strong> of the University of Tennessee: “Eric is one of the most well-respected and influential&nbsp;professional&nbsp;apiculturists&nbsp;in the nation. If I could select one person to represent the&nbsp;apicultural&nbsp;scientific community&nbsp;including research, regulation and extension, I would choose Eric.”</p>

         </div> 
        </div> Mussen's&nbsp;team of nominators singled him out for his “amazing knowledge of bees, his excellent communication skills in a diverseclientele, including researchers, Extension personnel, legislators,&nbsp;commodity boards, grower organizations, pesticide regulators, students, news media, and beekeeping associations at the&nbsp;national, state and local levels; his eagerness to help everyone, no matter the age or stature or expertise, from an&nbsp;inquiring 4-H'er to a beginning beekeeper to a commercial beekeeper; and his &nbsp;ability to translate complicated research in&nbsp;lay terms.” He presented multiple talks to every beekeeping association in California, and spoke at a variety of events, including pollinator workshops,&nbsp;animal biology classes, UC events, and fairs and festivals. 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>The nominators lauded him for “his valuable research, which includes papers on&nbsp;antibiotics to control American foulbrood; fungicide toxicity in the almond orchards; the effect of light brown apple&nbsp;moth mating pheromone on honey bees; the effects of high fructose corn syrup and probiotics on bee colonies; and the&nbsp;invasion and behavior of Africanized bees. He was often consulted on colony collapse disorder and bee nutrition.”</p> 
        <p>Overall,&nbsp;Mussen was known as "a well-respected, well-liked,&nbsp;honest, and unflappable person with a delightful sense of humor."</p> 
        <p>Mussen was a longtime board member of the California State Beekeepers' Association and a consultant for the Almond Board of California. He co-founded the Western Apicultural Society, serving six terms as president, the last during the 40th anniversary conference at UC Davis in 2017. He also was involved in the formation of the American Association of Professional Apiculturists and held the offices of president or treasurer of that association for many years. He was a scientific advisor to the UC Davis Honey and Pollination Center.</p> 
        <p>Mussen was instrumental in the development of the Almond Board of California's Honey Bee Best Management Practices for Almonds. The Almond Board honored him with a service award, describing him as being an “authoritative and trusted source for guidance on research, technical, and practical problem solving and issues facing both industries.”&nbsp; Shortly after he retired, both the CSBA and WAS created an Eric Mussen&nbsp;Award to present to their outstanding members.</p> 
        <p>“Eric is a worldwide authority on honey bees, but no problem is too small and no question too involved for him to answer,” said the late Extension entomologist <strong>Larry Godfrey</strong> prior to Mussen's retirement. “He devotes his research and extension activities to the improvement of honey bee health and honey bee colony management practices. Eric helps growers, consumers, UC Farm Advisors, agricultural commissioners, scientists, beekeepers, researchers, pesticide regulators, 4-H'ers, and state and national agricultural and apicultural organizations. He ignites their interest in maintaining the health of bees, cultivates their friendship, and generously gives of his time and intellect.”</p> 
        <p><strong>William Hutchison</strong>, professor and head of the Department of Entomology at the University of Minnesota, who presented him with the 2013&nbsp;Alexander&nbsp;Hodson&nbsp;Graduate Alumni Award, related at the ceremony that&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;tackled "many new challenges–mites, diseases, and Africanized honey bees, to name a few–to enhance the pollination success of California's diverse agricultural cropping systems, with considerable emphasis on almonds. In brief, he is in demand, and he continues to be a primary source for objective information on honey bee health and pollination in California."</p> 
        <p>In his retirement years--in between his family commitments and his hobbies of birding and singing doo-wop with a local group--Mussen&nbsp;not only served as the 2017 president of the Western Apicultural&nbsp;Society but doubled as the program chair at the UC Davis conference. He reviewed funding proposals for Project Apis m., which makes funding decisions and handles the funds for the National Honey Board and other entities; and served on the scientific review panel for the Bee Informed Partnership organization, which reviews funding requests of tech teams. He was a scientific advisor&nbsp;to the UC Davis Honey and Pollination Center.&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>"I am basically all pro-bee,”&nbsp;Mussen&nbsp;told the&nbsp;<em>American Bee Journal</em>&nbsp;in a two-part feature story published in September 2011. “Whatever I can do for bees, I do it...It doesn't matter whether there is one hive in the backyard or 15,000 colonies. Bees are bees and the bees' needs are the bees' needs.”</p> 
        <p>A celebration of life is expected to take place at UC Davis.</p>
