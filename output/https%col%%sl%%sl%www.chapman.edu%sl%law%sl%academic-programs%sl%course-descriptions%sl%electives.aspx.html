           <p><strong>International Business Transactions (3) Law-7559</strong><br>This is a three-credit survey course designed to acquaint students with some of the issues involved in the&nbsp;conduct of international business transactions. We will examine the various methods of doing business abroad,&nbsp;moving from relatively simple to progressively more involved transactions -- for example, beginning with a basic&nbsp;sale and financing of goods across national borders to the establishment of a productive operation abroad through&nbsp;foreign franchisees, technology licensing arrangements and finally, direct investment in foreign enterprises. The last&nbsp;part of the course will focus on the resolution of international commercial disputes.&nbsp;We will study these transactions in a variety of political and economic settings -- economically developed nations,&nbsp;developing-country markets and non-market economies in transition. Even though there will be some discussion of&nbsp;national controls and international regulation of trade, for example, the World Trade Organization and the North&nbsp;American Free Trade Agreement, the primary focus of the course is on private international business law (sales&nbsp;contracts, trademark licenses, intellectual property infringements, investment contracts, etc.). We will touch on an&nbsp;extensive range of substantive laws, such as the law of corporations, commercial transactions and the uniform&nbsp;commercial code, antitrust, intellectual property (copyright, trademark, patent), conflict of laws, civil procedure,&nbsp;contracts, international trade as well as public international law. Any knowledge or background in some of these&nbsp;areas will be helpful. However, there are no prerequisites for this course.&nbsp;The course is designed to help students become “practice ready.” That is, students will learn transactional skills and&nbsp;work with actual contracts. In addition to learning substantive laws and legal doctrine, students will also learn&nbsp;different strategies of negotiation. Negotiation skills will be incorporated into and seamlessly mesh with the&nbsp;substantive laws in different sections of the course. In this respect, students will not only learn how to draft and&nbsp;mark up different types of contracts but will also be exposed to different approaches to negotiation by engaging in&nbsp;simulated negotiations. These simulated negotiations play out in different settings – transactions, dispute resolution&nbsp;and other situations lawyers encounter in practice.&nbsp;<span>This course will satisfy the Lawyering Skills requirement.&nbsp;This course is an approved elective for the Business Law Certificate and the International Law Certificate.</span></p>
