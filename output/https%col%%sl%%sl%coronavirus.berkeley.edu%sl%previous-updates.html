         <p class=""><em>The following update will be shared in today’s </em>Response &amp; Recovery<em> newsletter:</em></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masks will continue to be required indoors for an additional week — through Sunday, March 6 — with masks remaining strongly recommended for fully vaccinated individuals beginning Monday, March 7.</span></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who is not fully vaccinated, masks will continue to be required indoors on and after March 7. In order to be considered fully vaccinated, you must have received your primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine booster if eligible, as well as the flu vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, masks are optional for everyone outdoors.</span></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-week delay is in response to feedback received by the Recovery Management Team. Many people remain very apprehensive about being indoors with people who are not wearing masks. In response to these concerns, and to give people who have special health vulnerabilities additional opportunities to request specific individual relief, the RMT is extending the indoor mask mandate for an additional week.</span></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no longer any CDC, California Department of Public Health or local public health recommendation to mandate masks in higher education settings. But all three strongly recommend that individuals continue to wear masks indoors based upon current conditions. That is why the campus is moving from “masks required for all indoors” to “masks strongly recommended for all indoors.” Throughout the pandemic, the campus has prioritized alignment with public health guidance and continues to do so.</span></p> 
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus leadership will continue to consult with campus stakeholders and closely monitor local infection rates, local hospitalization rates, CDC guidance, the anticipated availability of vaccination to children under age 5, and other relevant information to ensure that campus policies regarding masks continue to be in alignment with prevailing public health guidance.</span></p>

         <p class=""><a href="https://mailchi.mp/berkeley.edu/response-recovery-2022-02-11">This week’s Response &amp; Recovery newsletter</a> included an update on face coverings requirements:</p> 
         <p class="">As has been widely reported, the California Department of Public Health and the City of Berkeley Division of Public Health will <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/City_Manager/Press_Releases/2022/2022-02-09_Health_Officers%E2%80%99_Joint_Statement__Businesses,_organizations_will_be_able_to_set_mask_rules_for_vaccinated_people_starting_Feb__16.aspx">no longer mandate that face coverings be worn indoors by people <strong>who are vaccinated</strong></a>, in most settings, beginning this coming Wednesday. The Recovery Management Team has decided to continue to require that face coverings be worn indoors on campus, in accordance with campus requirements currently in effect, through Sunday, Feb. 27.</p> 
         <p class="">The campus is expecting that fully vaccinated (and boosted, for those who are booster eligible) faculty, staff and students will no longer be required to wear face coverings indoors in most campus settings beginning Monday, Feb. 28. The period of time prior to Feb. 28 will be used to consult with campus stakeholders about settings in which face coverings may continue to be mandated and to plan operationally for transitioning to face coverings being strongly recommended but not mandated.</p> 
         <p class="">In order to be present on campus, faculty, staff and students must comply with the <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/requirements/covid19">UC vaccination policy</a>, <strong>including the requirement to get the booster shot once eligible</strong>.</p> 
         <p class=""><strong>All individuals, regardless of vaccination status, will continue to be strongly recommended to wear a face covering indoors as case rates remain high.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
         <p class="">During this transition period:</p> 
         <ul class=""> 
          <li aria-level="1">Signage will be prepared to align with the new face coverings guidance. Per public health order, signage needs to be posted requiring anyone who enters a building to be prepared to attest to being fully vaccinated if not wearing a face covering.</li> 
          <li aria-level="1">Campus leadership will continue to consult with campus stakeholders and closely monitor local infection rates, local hospitalization rates, CDC guidance, the anticipated availability of vaccination to children under age 5, and other relevant information to determine whether transitioning to a policy of face coverings being highly recommended remains in alignment with public health guidance.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p class="">Before making the decision to keep the indoor face covering requirement in effect while transitioning to a policy of face coverings being strongly recommended, the Recovery Management Team reviewed the recommendations of the UC Berkeley Public Health Committee and considered the needs of those most vulnerable within our community. Protecting the health and safety of the campus community while preserving the mission of the university continue to be the guiding principles in any decision-making.</p> 
         <p class="">Throughout the pandemic, UC Berkeley has closely aligned with local public health guidance. Moving from mandating to strongly recommending face coverings indoors, in alignment with the public health orders, is a sensible next step in the return to normalcy as pandemic conditions improve.</p>

         <p class=""><a href="https://mailchi.mp/berkeley.edu/response-recovery-2022-01-21">This week’s <em>Response &amp; Recovery</em> newsletter</a> included a public health update from Guy Nicolette, assistant vice chancellor for University Health Services:</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">We’re continuing to see a high number of cases both within UC Berkeley and in the broader community. The good news is that we’re seeing milder cases than with previous variants and it appears that the peak of the Bay Area omicron surge is behind us.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">With so many cases right now, some have asked why we’re still planning to resume in-person instruction on Jan. 31. Others have been asking why we didn’t start the semester with in-person instruction when other activities are still in-person.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Throughout the pandemic, we’ve had to weigh the benefits of public health measures against the negative impacts of those measures on mental, social, physical and financial health. The general consensus of the public health community (endorsed by our own campus public health committee) is that the public health benefits of in-person instruction outweigh the risks — even amidst this surge.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Delaying in-person instruction by two weeks is allowing us time to address the operational challenges we’ll face when high numbers of students, staff and faculty are temporarily unable to come to campus due to COVID-19. It remains the primary goal of the Recovery Management Team and its subcommittees to be ready to resume in-person instruction on Jan. 31.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Given that there is no federal, state or local guidance discouraging in-person university instruction, evidence to suggest omicron is likely to start decelerating soon, and hearing compelling reasons for the return to on-site learning tips the balance of risk in favor of in-person instruction.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">With a continued emphasis on boosters, high-quality masking indoors, staying home when you’re sick, and testing when advised, we’ll continue to manage through this latest wave while maintaining the in-person instruction and activities so important to the mission of our university.</p>

         <p class="">There has been a surge in positive COVID-19 cases on campus over the last two weeks, as expected. With the high transmissibility of the omicron variant and the return of more students and staff to campus, we anticipate that the number will continue to increase through January.</p> 
         <p class="">You’re reminded to continue to follow <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/campus-access/">requirements for being on campus</a>, including&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/face-coverings/">wearing face coverings while indoors</a>&nbsp;and staying home when sick. Please also review the information on&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/what-do-if-test-positive">what to do if you test positive</a>.</p> 
         <p class="">Given the surge in cases, and the related overwhelming increase in contact tracing and case investigations, University Health Services data-gathering efforts will be stretched. We do not anticipate sending additional WarnMe notifications until the current spike in omicron variant cases has decelerated. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/">campus dashboard</a>&nbsp;will continue to provide information about testing conducted by UHS.

         <p class="">Following up on our campus message last week, I want to clarify what to expect when we resume in-person instruction on Monday, Jan. 31.</p> 
         <p class="">While the omicron wave is expected to peak in January, it is not expected to substantially subside prior to Jan. 31. This means that we expect high numbers of students, staff and faculty who are not able to come to campus for COVID-19 related reasons. The two-week period of remote instruction will be used to plan for how best to operate the campus with reduced staffing.</p> 
         <p class="">Due to anticipated staffing shortages, you should expect reduced service levels and longer wait times when accessing campus services. Please be patient and understanding during this challenging time.</p> 
         <p class="">Instructors, we ask that you extend grace to students who may be facing challenges at home and be as accommodating as possible. Students, we in turn ask that you recognize the burden this places on instructors and staff and extend grace as well. For everyone, please practice empathy and compassion as we navigate the next several weeks together.</p> 
         <p class="">The omicron wave may look very different than past surges we’ve experienced but our principles are the same. We’ll continue to take sensible precautions and follow the advice of our campus public health experts while preserving our core function as an in-person university and furthering our mission.</p>

         <p class="">As of this update, UC Berkeley is moving forward with its <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/10/04/uc-berkeley-plans-all-in-person-classes-for-spring-2022/">instructional plans</a> for the spring 2022 semester, which include returning to fully in-person instruction regardless of class size.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Omicron</h3> 
         <p class="">The campus is monitoring the developments related to the omicron variant very closely. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, plans are contingent upon the public health situation and are subject to change. Any changes to the plans outlined below will be communicated broadly to the campus community.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Face coverings</h3> 
         <p class="">In light of the increased transmissibility of the omicron variant and based on the recommendations of the Public Health Committee, UC Berkeley will continue to <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/face-coverings/">require face coverings</a> indoors for the foreseeable future. This decision aligns with a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">new state of California requirement</a> that face coverings be worn indoors statewide Dec. 15, 2021 through Jan. 15, 2022.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Testing and travel</h3> 
         <p class="">If you will be traveling over the winter break, it is strongly recommended that you <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19">get tested</a>. Testing is recommended prior to and 3–5 days after <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/health-information/travel-guidance">travel</a> or engaging in other high-risk activities such as attending gatherings indoors where face coverings are not required.</p> 
         <p class="">Requirements for students living in campus housing are being communicated directly to students impacted. UC Berkeley is also exploring increasing the frequency of testing of fully vaccinated individuals.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Boosters</h3> 
         <p class="">You’re <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/12/a-message-from-president-michael-v.-drake-on-covid-vaccine-boosters.html">highly encouraged</a> to get the COVID-19 vaccine booster as soon as the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Vaccine-Boosters.aspx">recommended time has elapsed since your final vaccination dose</a>. While more study into the efficacy of boosters against omicron is needed, the CDC recommends that you <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/vaccines-covid-19">get the booster</a> as soon as you’re able to.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Accommodations</h3> 
         <p class="">UC Berkeley remains committed to meeting the needs of all students, staff and faculty, including those who are immunocompromised or with other conditions made worse by the pandemic. Staffing shortages in the <a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu/">Disabled Students’ Program</a> are being addressed to meet the increased demand for services. Instructors wishing to request remote instruction due to disability, dependent care or health conditions are encouraged to review a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrYbGYXSxlj61C4eQ6rr4MngWr_vbzyF0UdiVAcjJ1U/edit?usp=sharing">quick guide for remote teaching requests for spring 2022</a>.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Delivery of instruction for spring 2022</h3> 
         <p class="">UC Berkeley has never intended to offer hybrid instruction as a standard option, as this modality is extremely challenging for instructors and detracts from the experience for students. Holding courses with enrollments over 200 fully remote in the fall 2021 semester was an attempt to offer both in-person and remote instruction options while avoiding the hybrid model. This proved to have its own challenges. Students found it challenging to transition from in-person instruction to remote instruction with not enough time to travel between home and classrooms. Instructors and students found it harder to engage in remote learning because students had to join courses from locations where they could only listen in to lectures.</p> 
         <p class="">For these reasons, UC Berkeley plans to move forward with plans for fully in-person instruction as its default mode in the spring. If public health conditions require a pivot to remote learning, all courses will move to remote learning instead of just some courses.</p> 
         <p class="">In contrast to the fall of 2021 where UC Berkeley was among the first campuses to start instruction, many campuses on the quarter system will already have commenced instruction in early January. Campus leaders will be closely monitoring the progress and challenges of other campuses leading up to the start of instruction on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022.</p> 
         <h3 class="">Thresholds for making decisions</h3> 
         <p class="">Some have asked for thresholds related to case counts and other public health measures for when UC Berkeley would pivot to remote instruction. While the Public Health Committee has a number of factors it is monitoring related to the pandemic, given the unknowns and the complexity of the situation final decisions about any changes to campus operations are made using the totality of information available. The Recovery Management Team meets regularly to review the latest public health information and recommendations of the Public Health Committee. Every effort will be made to communicate any changes with as much notice as possible.</p>

         <p class="">More than 40 students or staff affiliated with the Cal Football program have tested positive for COVID-19 over the last 2 weeks. Everyone is reminded to continue to follow safety protocols.</p> 
         <p class="">University Health Services, working in coordination with local public health authorities, has put in place additional testing and protocols that are <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/covid-19-outbreaks-information-and-protocols">required for outbreaks</a> for 20 or more people. The latest testing has indicated only a few new positives, which shows the numbers are trending in the right direction. All members of the campus community are reminded to remain vigilant.</p> 
         <p class="">Everyone in the campus community should (1) use the symptom screener daily, (2) stay home when they have symptoms, (3) comply with the campus vaccination policy, (4) test when specifically directed to do by the campus and (5) observe the campus indoor face covering requirements, which we remind everyone are more restrictive than the city’s indoor face covering requirement.</p>

         <p class="">In response to feedback from faculty and students, University Health Services, the Office of the Registrar and the Student Information Systems in IST have developed a process for notifying instructors and students of potential exposures in the classroom. If a student or instructor tests positive after attending a class during the infectious period, everyone who is registered for the class will receive an email notification.</p>
         <p class="">This new email notification will be in addition to the usual contact-tracing process, during which we identify and notify close contacts by phone and/or text. It is very important to note that a “potential exposure” notification is different from being identified as a close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual. Given campus vaccination rates and face-covering policies, you are likely to be at a lower risk than an identified contact, and no greater risk than, for example, visiting a supermarket.</p>
         <p class="">To protect privacy, the notification will not include details about the course or the individual who tested positive. The potential exposure notification will include instructions and suggested actions. No one will need to quarantine as a result of a potential exposure notification. Testing is optional for fully vaccinated individuals and advised for not fully vaccinated individuals.</p>
         <p class="">For more information on what to expect when someone tests positive, please visit the <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/return-to-campus/positive-cases/">positive cases page</a>.</p>

         <p class="" dir="ltr">With COVID-19 cases rising locally, Bay Area county and City of Berkeley health authorities announced Friday that they are again recommending that everyone resume wearing face coverings while in indoor public places like grocery or retail stores, theaters, and family entertainment centers regardless of vaccination status to ensure easy verification that all unvaccinated people are masked in those settings and as an extra precautionary measure for all.</p> 
         <p class="" dir="ltr">In light of this guidance, campus units are authorized to require that face coverings be worn in indoor facilities that serve students and/or the general public.

         <p class="" dir="ltr">As a residential campus, most of UC Berkeley’s academic and cocurricular activities are designed to be experienced in person. This will once again be the case this fall and students are expected to be in residence in time to observe a one-week period for testing, vaccination for those who need it, and self-sequester before the start of in-person classes. Most courses will not have an “all-remote” option.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">A limited number of remote offerings are being made available primarily to support the needs of international students who may not be able to enter the country. As always, if you need accommodations for a disability in order to fully participate in your in-person courses or to postpone your studies until you are able to attend your courses in person, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu/">Disabled Students’ Program website</a>&nbsp;to apply for services.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">We recognize that more than a year into the pandemic it can be hard to imagine returning to a “close-to-normal” way of life. As conditions continue to improve and additional restrictions lift, we hope it will be easier to see yourself back on campus.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Please note that as we head into the fall, being vaccinated will become the primary means of preventing infection by the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The campus continues to follow Berkeley Public Health Department guidance and state regulations. Many temporary public health measures such as physical distancing, capacity restrictions, enhanced cleaning, increased attention to ventilation&nbsp;and testing will be reduced, or in some cases, no longer be necessary thanks to the widespread availability of the vaccine.</p>

         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the importance of vaccination, UC is engaging its community in a discussion of the details of the proposed policy now so that students, faculty, academic appointees and staff will have ample time to obtain the vaccine ahead of the fall term.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed policy, the university would require students, faculty, academic appointees and staff who are accessing campus facilities at any UC location beginning this fall to be immunized against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. UC already strongly encourages students, faculty, academic appointees and staff to voluntarily obtain a vaccination as soon as they are eligible and able to schedule an appointment. The requirement would go into effect once a vaccine has full approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</span></p>

         <p>There are two important updates related to vaccines: </p>
         <h3>Vaccine records can now be uploaded to eTang</h3>
         <p> Faculty, staff, and students who have been vaccinated outside of University Health Services are strongly encouraged to upload their vaccine records to <a href="http://etang.berkeley.edu">eTang</a>. When you log onto eTang, click Medical Clearances and update the COVID-19 Vaccine section by uploading a photo of your vaccine card and entering vaccine date(s) and type. A COVID-19 vaccine declination form and process will also be rolled out soon. </p>
         <h3>Testing requirements change for those fully vaccinated</h3>
         <p> Effective April 1, campus surveillance testing requirements are being changed for fully vaccinated faculty, staff, and students. You’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days after your final vaccine dose. </p>
         <ul>
          <li aria-level="1">Vaccinated students living in on-campus housing or participating in athletics will still be required to get tested, but the frequency will change from twice weekly to once a week.</li>
          <li aria-level="1">For everyone else, weekly testing will not be required for 90 days from the date of your final vaccine.</li>
         </ul>
         <p> In order to be compliant with the campus requirements to have a green badge, and for your testing badge to reflect these new requirements, you must have had at least one COVID test through a campus testing site, and outside vaccination must be documented in eTang (see above). Once you come in for one <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">surveillance test</a>, UHS can change your testing badge status automatically when you are fully vaccinated. Vaccinated people should still isolate/quarantine and come in for diagnostic testing (at UHS, as scheduled in eTang) if they become symptomatic, or are in close contact with a case and live in congregate housing. The Public Health Committee is still reviewing what the surveillance testing frequency for those fully vaccinated will look like beyond this 90 day period as well as what the testing plan may look like for the Fall.</p>

         <h3 class="">Campus requirements are different than those for individuals</h3>

It’s important to know that there are different public health expectations for universities, workplaces, congregate living situations, and individual households. Also, the state still requires that social, non-work, non-instructional gatherings be limited to not more than three households, with face coverings and six-foot distancing even among fully vaccinated individuals.</p>
         <p class="">At this time, even if you have been vaccinated, you’re still required to wear a face covering, <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">get tested</a>, <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/surveillance-testing/surveillance-testing-badge-system">show your badge</a> for entrance to campus facilities, and comply with all other requirements for <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/working-on-campus/">working on campus</a> until stated otherwise. These guidelines, as well as emerging evidence and the latest CDC guidance, are currently under review and any updates will be announced in the <a href="https://us1.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=646f20d1372fb21b168a9f006&amp;id=940930e328">Response and Recovery newsletter</a>.</p>

         <p class="">Even though some office use is permitted in the orange tier, working remotely is still encouraged by the state guidelines. Discussions are underway about increasing on-campus activities as we approach the fall and more information will be shared in the coming weeks. The <a href="https://vpap.berkeley.edu/FutureOfWork">UC Berkeley Future of Work Committee</a> and the <a href="https://evcp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/deans_work_group_for_the_future_of_work_charge_2021_03_04.pdf">Dean’s Working Group on Future of Work</a> are also looking at what work will look like long-term. In the meantime, do not expect any immediate changes to work from home.</p>

         <p>A new <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/wastewater/">wastewater testing dashboard</a> is now available in the dashboard section of this website. UC Berkeley monitors levels of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in sewage at several locations around campus. This wastewater monitoring allows for broader tracking of virus levels in the campus population that is unbiased by who accesses individual testing. It may also provide an early warning of outbreaks, because people with COVID-19 may shed the virus in feces before they show symptoms (and even if they never show symptoms). UC Berkeley began monitoring several campus wastewater locations for SARS-CoV-2 beginning in summer 2020. Sample collection is conducted by a team from the campus Office of Environment, Health &amp; Safety, and testing of the samples is performed in a temporary laboratory established by Prof. Kara Nelson’s research group.</p>

         <p class="">In an effort to do everything possible to avoid another surge of COVID-19 cases after spring break, and another extended quarantine period, campus leaders have made the decision to implement a <a href="https://housing.berkeley.edu/2020-21">mandatory self-sequester for all students living in the residence halls</a> including those in suites and mini-suites from March 26 through at least April 8. Some other key highlights about the sequester:</p>
         <ul class="">
          <li aria-level="1">Solo outdoor exercise will be permitted during the sequester.</li>
          <li aria-level="1">The mandatory self-sequester does not apply to students living in apartments, though if you travel or engage in high-risk activities during spring break, you must still self-sequester for 10 days after your return.</li>
          <li aria-level="1">It is critical that you remain on your <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">UHS testing schedule</a> before, during and after spring break.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://caldining.berkeley.edu/covid19/#ws">Dining services will also be modified</a> during the sequester.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="">Please also keep in mind that while the CDC recently released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">new interim public health recommendations for fully vaccinated people</a>, these guidelines do not currently apply to students living in congregate settings such as the residence halls.</p>

         <p> According to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx">state guidelines</a>, persons at risk of occupational exposure to COVID-19 through their work in any role in education settings are eligible to be vaccinated, further referenced by those guidelines as all staff of universities. This <em>may</em> include faculty and staff and also <em>may</em> include postdocs, graduate student instructors, graduate student researchers, readers, tutors, student assistants, and any other form of campus employee. <em>Please note that eligibility requirements are set by the vaccination provider and UC Berkeley is not able to guarantee eligibility.</em> </p>
         <h3>What verification is needed?</h3>
         <p> You’re advised to bring a pay stub and your UC Berkeley photo ID to your vaccination appointment. <em>Please note that verification requirements are set by the vaccination provider and you may be asked to provide additional documentation.</em> </p>
         <h3>How do I get the vaccine?</h3>
         <p> You’re encouraged to contact your health care provider and/or visit the California Department of Public Health <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn website</a> to check your eligibility, receive a notification when vaccines and appointments are available in your area, or book an appointment.</p>

It could also mean that the University of California system will no longer receive vaccine doses for the purpose of vaccinating members of the campus community, at least until the vaccine is more widely available.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">While UC Health officials are currently engaging in advocacy with the state for campuses to continue to receive vaccines, we are unlikely to receive new vaccine doses for at least the next two weeks.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">It is our understanding that we will receive second doses for those who have received their first doses from University Health Services (UHS). We will continue to update&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/vaccines-covid-19">our webpage on vaccine distribution</a>&nbsp;as the situation develops.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">According to California Department of Public Health (CDPH)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx">guidelines</a>, anyone working in higher education (meaning all UC Berkeley employees — faculty and staff alike), is working in the “education sector” (as defined by the CDPH) and is therefore eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Visit the CDPH&nbsp;<a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">“My Turn” website</a>&nbsp;to receive a notification when vaccines are available in your area and when you are eligible to receive a vaccination. Additional opportunities may also be available through your health care provider.</p>

         <p class="">New guidance has been issued in anticipation of resuming limited in-person activities as of March 29. It was <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/2021/02/friday-feb-5-8-a-m/">previously communicated</a> that non-academic in-person activities and gatherings are suspended through March 28, 2021.</p>
         <p class="">The limited resumption of activities will only include participatory gatherings that cannot be conducted remotely. Activities that include a non-participating audience observing a speech, performance, program, or other activity carried out by a limited number of the participants should be conducted remotely and will not be approved to take place in-person.</p>
         <p class="">Campus departments or Registered Student Organizations that meet the criteria available on the <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/events/">events page</a> can begin to submit their in-person participatory activities for pre-approval to the activities recovery coordinator. This guidance represents a roadmap for a resumption of activities based on improved public health conditions in the future and is intended to provide the necessary information in order to prepare.</p>

         <h3>Update on spring in-person instruction</h3>
         <p> The timeline for resuming in-person instruction has been updated given the recent surge in cases within the campus community. </p>
         <ul>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Monday, Feb. 8</strong>: Occasional outdoor in-person <em>graduate</em> student instruction was permitted to begin this week.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Tuesday, Feb. 16</strong>: Occasional outdoor in-person <em>undergraduate</em> student instruction can begin next week, following the holiday.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Monday, Feb. 22</strong>: The small pilot of indoor in-person instruction has been approved to move forward but has been delayed by one week.</li>
         </ul>
         <p> As is always the case, all plans are contingent upon the terms of public health orders in effect on the dates of their planned implementation and are subject to change. </p>
         <h3>New walk-up testing site for students in residence halls</h3>
         <p dir="ltr">An additional COVID-19 surveillance testing location has opened at the Underhill Parking Garage for students living in residence halls. The site is available for walk-up appointments on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 8 a.m. to noon. Appointments are needed and can be booked through&nbsp;<a href="http://etang.berkeley.edu">eTang</a>.&nbsp;The walk-up testing site at Underhill will be open on Monday, Feb. 15.</p>
         <p dir="ltr">Walk-thru testing is accessed via the garage entrance on Channing Way. Please note that the walk-up option ends at noon so that the location can be set up for drive-thru testing beginning at 1 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.</p>
         <p dir="ltr">This new testing option is in addition to the existing RSF, Memorial Stadium, Underhill drive-thru, and UVA testing sites and will hopefully be another convenient option for those living in the residence halls.</p>
         <h3>Some testing sites closed on Monday for holiday</h3>
         <p dir="ltr">The walk-up testing sites at RSF and Memorial Stadium, as well as the drive-thru site at Underhill Parking Garage, will be closed on Monday, Feb. 15 for Presidents Day. Please note that testing sites tend to be busier on the Tuesday following a holiday, so you may want to plan your testing schedule accordingly. As noted above, the new walk-up testing site at Underhill for students living in residence halls will be open.</p>
         <h3>Important update on Library due dates</h3>
         <p dir="ltr">After multiple due date extensions because of the pandemic, starting Feb. 1, 2021, all materials checked out from the UC Berkeley Library have regular due dates. Patrons with materials checked out before Sept. 1, 2020, are urged to renew or return them by Feb. 17, 2021, before the system marks the items as overdue and blocks their account.

         <p class="">Due to the <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/">recent surge </a>in COVID-19 cases in on-campus student housing, campus officials are now directing students in all residence halls to self-sequester, a move designed to help contain the spread.</p>
         <p class="">This decision was made Monday in consultation with Berkeley Public Health and will continue until at least Monday, Feb. 8, when a re-evaluation will occur.</p>
         <p class="">During this period students must stay in their rooms as much as possible and wear face coverings in any common areas within their household. Their twice-weekly COVID-19 testing should continue. <a href="https://mailchi.mp/8c3cd17bbd39/urgent-sequestering-effective-02012021-for-all-residential-hall-residents">Detailed instructions</a> were sent to residence hall students today.</p>
         <p class="">Over the last few days, the campus has had a surge in positive COVID-19 cases both in the residence halls and among students in off-campus housing, including some in the CalGreeks community. Many more students have been identified as contacts who were potentially exposed to the virus.</p>
         <p class="">The surge in cases is believed to be tied to small off-campus gatherings.</p>
         <p class="">University Health Services (UHS) officials will continue to find isolation/quarantine spaces for residence hall students who have tested positive or who are considered high-risk contacts.</p>
         <p class="">The new directive applies only to residence halls, meaning dormitory-style campus housing. It does not apply to students living in on-campus apartments or students who are living off-campus. Officials with UHS and the Division of Student Affairs will reach out to the various student communities as needed, to provide guidance and support.&nbsp; No matter where you live, though, everyone is advised to be especially vigilant amid this surge, continuing to wear face coverings, keeping physically distant from people outside your household, not gathering with people from outside your household, getting tested regularly, and washing your hands frequently.</p>

         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">All non-essential in-person activities and events were previously suspended through Dec. 31, 2020. As we near the end of that period, the Recovery Management Team (RMT) has extended the current prohibition on in-person activities (other than approved instruction, essential research, and essential work) through Feb. 28, 2021, while endorsing a roadmap that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable some in-person activities in the spring term, provided public health conditions improve.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roadmap outlines plans to:</span></p>
         <ul class="">
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow in-person participatory activities that cannot be conducted virtually in the spring semester no earlier than March 1, 2021, if public health conditions improve to the state’s “red” tier or better. In-person participatory activities are defined as events where the participants must be actively participating to conduct the event and they could not participate effectively virtually. For example, drum circles, dance rehearsals, etc. To meet state guidelines, we must pursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, wherever possible.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit the number of approved event spaces in order to be successful in managing compliance with university and public health requirements.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit attendance at approved in-person activities to students, and faculty and staff who are approved to work on campus.&nbsp; In-person activities with non-affiliates and faculty and staff who are not already on campus remain prohibited.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct approved event venues to prepare to host limited in-person activities for the attendees specified above.</span></li>
          <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assign responsibility to the Events and External Relations Recovery Sub-Committee to approve event spaces and requested individual activities.</span></li>
         </ul>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional specific details about how activities would resume and the process for approvals will be forthcoming, as soon as they are available.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events and External Relations Recovery Sub-Committee acknowledges that the devastating increase in virus transmission we are currently experiencing makes it difficult to envision successfully conducting in-person gatherings in just a few months. However, their goal is to prepare now for improved conditions that would allow these limited activities to resume on campus. As always, they continue to prioritize the health and well-being of the entire campus community.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions or comments, please send them to the Events and External Relations Recovery Sub-committee </span><a href="https://forms.gle/RpUkGH8tnhSyWbs69"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

         <p dir="ltr">When the Library moves to Chapter 3, it will open one study space for Berkeley students —&nbsp;hopefully in the spring semester. Preparations for this are underway. Factors that influence a transition to this chapter include the COVID-19 tier for our area, building functionality and density due to other services, and proximity to Library collections (which could impact the campus’s expanded access to millions of e-books).</p>
         <p dir="ltr">When study spaces open, Berkeley students will need to make a reservation for an assigned seat for a limited period of time. Students will need to wear a face mask at all times while in the building (sorry, no eating and drinking) and maintain appropriate social distancing.</p>
         <p dir="ltr">As circumstances improve and support the move to Chapter 4, the Library will expand study space locations to accommodate more Berkeley students while maintaining low density. In the meantime, with its expanded slate of services, the Library continues to serve as a reliable beacon of knowledge, even in the stormiest of seasons.</p>

         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus is experiencing a notable uptick in positive COVID-19 cases among students and some staff, which is believed to be tied to Thanksgiving gatherings.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been 50 new cases since Thanksgiving, compared to less than 10 the week before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to University Health Services. This follows confirmation late last week of SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, being found in the wastewater at both University Village, campus family housing in Albany, and the Clark Kerr campus residence halls. However, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in people living outside of campus housing units.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Health Services has learned through its contact tracing efforts that the positive cases appear to be linked to Thanksgiving gatherings, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost half being linked to travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and COVID-19 spreading in the broader community. Cases linked to Thanksgiving events are likely to continue to emerge this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight of the new 50 cases were among staff.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Staff who are on campus are reminded to continue to practice physical distancing and other best practices during downtime, even with colleagues that you work with all the time. UHS has learned that in some cases the spread appears to be tied to staff taking lunch breaks together and letting down their guard during those times.&nbsp; Taking off a mask to eat poses some risk: be sure to stay physically distanced, do not share utensils or food items, use hand hygiene before and after eating, and meet outside if weather allows rather than in a break room.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the percentage of COVID-19 positives in the campus community has remained under 2%, lower than in the surrounding community and the campus has not experienced any significant clusters of positive cases for some time. Still, the virus is currently spreading exponentially locally and nationwide: it is critical that we all remain</span><a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/health-information/protect-yourself-and-others-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vigilant.</span></a></p>

         <p>The campus has recently detected COVID-19 in University Village wastewater, a campus-owned family housing community about three miles from campus, in Albany. While students at UVA already have access to and are encouraged to participate in weekly campus COVID-19 surveillance testing held on-campus, University Health Services is responding to this development by offering and encouraging free COVID-19 testing onsite at University Village Thursday afternoon. Students at University Village have been encouraged to pick-up at-home saliva tests today, Thursday, Dec. 3, for drop-off tomorrow morning. The wastewater at <a href="https://housing.berkeley.edu/clarkkerr">Clark Kerr</a> student residences has also recently contained COVID-19. Students there have been instructed to schedule their <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">regularly required twice weekly surveillance testing</a> before the weekend. While there have been scattered COVID-19 cases at the Clark Kerr campus and University Village over the last few weeks there has been no notable increase in individuals testing positive at either location, as compared to the overall community. Overall, the percentage of<a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/"> COVID-19 positives</a> in the campus community has remained under 2%. There has been an uptick in cases in recent weeks, as has been the case in most of the United States, and everyone is reminded to <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/health-information/protect-yourself-and-others-covid-19">remain vigilant</a>. While we continue to see cases that are apparently related to holiday travel or gatherings, we are also seeing more cases without clear origin. Still, the campus has not experienced any significant clusters for some time. The good news is this means people seem to be limiting larger gatherings; the bad news is that the virus appears to be more diffusely spread throughout our local community. </p>
         <h2>Information on COVID-19 wastewater testing</h2>
         <p> As part of its COVID-19 surveillance strategy, researchers at UC Berkeley have partnered with Environment, Health &amp; Safety to <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/2020/10/thursday-oct-29-8-a-m/">monitor wastewater</a> from several areas in and around campus, using samplers placed strategically in sewer systems. We are only beginning to learn what positive signals mean, in terms of correlation with cases. We do not know if a positive signal means one person or five people, and we do not know how long people shed into the sewage system after infection, or if it correlates with someone who is infectious. Further, the testing may include wastewater from a nearby area, not just the campus property.</p>

         <p class="">UC Berkeley has adopted a recommendation to not use handheld temperature monitors in screening for building access, except as required by a public health order or regulatory requirement. This recommendation came from the Rapid Response Public Health Team, which is tasked with making timely public health recommendations to the campus.</p>
         <p class="">There is increasing evidence that temperature monitoring is an ineffective COVID-19 prevention strategy. One of the findings of <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/covid-19/safe-campus-initiative/">Berkeley’s Safe Campus Initiative</a> was the low positive predictive value of body temperature. Given the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, the lack of fever may even give one a false sense of security regarding infection. Furthermore, many handheld temperature readers lack sufficient sensitivity.</p>
         <p class="">The Daily Symptom Screener will continue to ask about temperature as one of many symptoms as it is believed to be appropriate in that context.</p>

         <p class="">This past spring, a group of operational leaders looked at the feasibility of offering instruction outdoors. They looked at a variety of factors, including access to restrooms and Wi-Fi, wheelchair accessibility and protection from the weather. It became clear that offering instruction outdoors on a regular basis was not practicable.</p>
         <p class="">More recently, another group was formed to look at a different approach. The <a href="https://evcp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/joint_academic_senate_administration_working_group_on_outdoor_space_for_instructional_activities_charge_2020_09_14.pdf">Joint Academic Senate and Administration Working Group on Outdoor Space for Instructional Activities (PDF)</a> has been charged with looking at other approaches, focused on smaller-scale, intermittent instructional activities. These activities are meant to complement remote instruction and eventually may also complement in-person indoor instruction. The hope is that the use of outdoor spaces will enable us to start very limited in-person instruction sooner, in order to improve instructional outcomes now and also to gain information that will be useful in returning to larger-scale in-person instruction as it becomes possible. The group has developed a proposal for very small pilot programs to take place before the Thanksgiving break.</p>
         <p class="">The proposal is being reviewed by UHS and the Berkeley public health officer for consideration. If approved, the pilot will inform future proposals to expand in-person instructional activities in the spring should public health conditions allow.</p>

         <p class="">As reported in Friday’s Response and Recovery newsletter, the campus asymptomatic<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing"> surveillance testing</a> program, which has been operating at the large Field House at Rec Sports, is expanding to offer COVID-19 testing to more of the campus community and opening an additional testing site.</p>
         <p class="">The effort initially focused on testing students living in congregate housing and staff in higher-risk roles on campus. Now in addition to students who live in on-campus or congregate housing, there is the capacity to test students living off-campus. And along with staff in higher-risk roles who have been getting regular testing, faculty and staff who come to campus for their work can also get tested. This expanded capacity will help when we can start having more on-campus classes and activities. See the <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">UHS surveillance testing page</a> for the breakdown of groups and the required or recommended frequency.</p>
         <p class="">Starting Wednesday, Oct. 9, a second surveillance testing site will open at Memorial Stadium, in the Gate 5 area of the Field Club. Appointments are required and can be booked through the University Health Service’s <a href="http://etang.berkeley.edu/">eTang portal</a>.</p>
         <p class="">Another testing option is through the IGI Fast Study. [UPDATED Jan. 4, 2021: The IGI FAST Study is now closed.]</p>
         <p class="">Along with preventative measures, regular surveillance testing is a critical component of helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This expansion will enable us to conduct 15,000 self-administered nasal swab (PCR) tests per week, with results expected within 48 hours. In addition to the expansion in testing locations and capacity, we continue to research and pilot new COVID-19 testing methods as they evolve and become available.</p>

         <p class="">We continue to find ourselves in uncharted waters in determining how to celebrate something as special as commencement. At this time, we are weighing options for three classes — December 2020, May 2021, and May 2020, the first class whose ceremony was disrupted by COVID-19. While every class is deserving of an in-person ceremony, all decisions depend on the status of the pandemic and on approval from local public health authorities.</p>
         <p class="">At this time, the December Class of 2020 will celebrate virtually on Saturday, Dec. 19, 2020. The May 2021 class is scheduled for May 15, 2021, but it is too early to determine whether that will be an in-person or virtual event. We are considering several options for the May 2020 class as well. We will reassess the status of the two May ceremonies by Feb. 1 to give students time to plan with their families. If we can hold an in-person ceremony on May 15, 2021, all December 2020 graduates will be invited to attend as well.</p>

         <p class="" dir="ltr">Since the start of the pandemic, University Health Services has been testing people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or who have had a close exposure with a positive case. This type of testing, referred to as&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/clinical-testing-symptoms-and-contacts">clinical testing or symptomatic testing</a>, continues to this day.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">In addition, the campus has been screening asymptomatic members of the UC Berkeley community. This type of testing is sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/campus-surveillance-testing">surveillance testing</a>, or community screening. This effort was initially focused on students living in congregate housing who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. It kicked off in August with students living in residence halls, who are required to be tested twice per week. This was followed by students living in congregate housing such as Greek houses and the co-ops. These students are also at high risk and are strongly encouraged to be tested.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Testing has also been expanded to clinical trainees and higher risk essential workers. Community screening was moved to the large Field House at the Rec Sports Facility to accommodate this expansion.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Regular surveillance testing is a critical component of helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The campus is working towards having the capacity to conduct up to 60,000 tests monthly and open up testing to more of the campus community. To accommodate this volume, an additional sample collection site will open at Memorial Stadium within the coming weeks.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">Faculty and staff who are currently approved to be on campus during the pandemic can also get tested through the IGI Saliva Testing (FAST) Study. Find out more and&nbsp;sign up for an appointment with IGI. [UPDATED Jan. 4, 2021: The IGI FAST Study is now closed.]</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">University Health Services does expect to see both isolated cases and small clusters within our campus population, given local epidemiology and transmission occurrences in the city of Berkeley. They see no cause for concern at the&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/">current rate</a>&nbsp;as long as everyone continues to wear facial coverings, maintains&nbsp;six feet of physical distance&nbsp;with non-household members and follows other public health guidelines. Contact tracing has been working well and those involved have been very cooperative.</p>
         <p class="" dir="ltr">With the increase in testing, it is both expected and advantageous that we are identifying cases that might have otherwise gone undetected. Through early identification, isolation, and contact tracing, we are able to get ahead of potential spreads, even before the infected person may be aware they are infectious.</p>

         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus has received the test results of all students tested before moving into the residence halls last week and, for transparency, we are sharing the test results with you.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 1,887 specimens tested, we had three students who tested positive and two students whose tests were inconclusive (we are treating them as positive cases). We had 26 insufficient specimens, which will require retesting, and 1,856 tested negative.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Guy Nicolette, assistant vice chancellor and head of University Health Services, the results are encouraging so far but it is important to remain vigilant. It is crucial that students continue to follow residence hall </span><a href="https://housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sequestering protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the standard steps, such as frequent hand washing and face coverings, to</span><a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/health-information/protect-yourself-and-others-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protect themselves </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and others.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that it can take several days after contracting COVID-19 to test positive for the virus. Someone who tests negative could still be infectious and test positive at a later date. It is also possible to be asymptomatic and transmit this infection. This is why it is so important that students continue to adhere to the sequestering protocols.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who tested positive or had inconclusive results were contacted by UHS, which works with the students to identify any close contacts.&nbsp; UHS coordinates with the city of Berkeley Public Health department to address positive test results and close contacts.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students who test positive or had close contacts with those students are temporarily housed at the Foothill residential housing complex on campus for isolation and quarantining until they are cleared by UHS to return to their assigned rooms.</span></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under campus move-in protocols, students were required to be tested at UHS before moving into the residential halls and then required to sequester in their residential room (all students are in single rooms) for 7-10 days. Thereafter, we will have regular </span><a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/move-covid-19-testing-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">follow up testing.</span></a></p>
         <p class=""><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of August 26, we have 102 students who have not yet moved in. Roughly half of these are students requesting a later move-in date. August&nbsp; 27 is the cutoff date for students to cancel their contracts with a $150 cancellation fee. Any new students moving in will also need to be tested before moving in.</span></p>

New international students are not permitted to enroll in schools where the instructional model is 100% online for the Fall 2020 semester. The guidance does allow schools to change their instructional model because of COVID-19.</p>
         <p class="">UC Berkeley has a hybrid instructional model in place for the Fall 2020 semester. Even though the fall semester will start with remote instruction, the overall instructional model remains hybrid in nature.

         <p class="">The UC Berkeley Library is preparing to expand its on-campus services as the fall semester nears. Plans on the horizon include launching a contactless pickup service and providing access to enhanced research consultations for special collections materials at The Bancroft Library. Both are scheduled for late summer.</p>
         <p class="">In light of the decision to start the fall semester fully remote, Moffitt Library will not open at the beginning of the fall semester as originally planned. When it does open, it will provide students with a low-density on-campus study space and will have limited hours, with strict social distancing protocols in place and no snacks and drinks allowed.</p>
         <p class="">While UC Berkeley’s library buildings are closed, Library users can still access a wealth of resources, including e-books, videos, databases, 24/7 help from librarians, and LinkedIn Learning courses.

         <p class="">With the increase in COVID-19 testing at University Health Services, we have moved from providing information about <a href="https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/confirmed-cases/">confirmed cases</a> in narrative summaries to a dashboards format. This will provide information on new cases as well as trends, at a glance. Perhaps the best feature is that information on new cases is reflected in real time.</p>
         <p class="">If disturbing trends or developments occur, the campus will, in addition, share that information with the campus community via posts on this web site or other campus communications.</p>
         <p class="">The dashboard shows the number of positive cases for tests performed at UHS, and does not include saliva tests performed through the Innovative Genomics Institute’s <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/06/30/uc-berkeley-launches-trial-of-saliva-test-for-covid-19/">FAST Study</a> in the campus kiosks.</p>

         <p><em>From Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration:</em> The university has decided to extend the cancellation or postponement of all campus-sponsored events through June and July. This decision was made given the unlikelihood that public health authorities would allow for such gatherings in the near future. It is our hope that this notice will assist everyone with their planning efforts. The directive applies to all departmental and administrative events held on university property. It does not apply to private events scheduled to take place in campus facilities; registered student organization events; or events produced by campus units but held in off-campus facilities. Summer activities for youth are not considered “events” and would not be covered by this directive. However, an extension of the terms of the current local shelter-in-place order could make any of the activities listed here unlawful.&nbsp; The current shelter-in-place order applicable to the main campus has no specific expiration date. For more on the status of campus activities please go to the <a href="/events/">events page</a>. Thank you for all that you continue to do for this community and please stay safe and be well.</p>

         <p>A UC Berkeley undergraduate student has tested positive for COVID-19. The student, who lives off campus in the city of Berkeley, is doing well. The student was tested at University Health Services. Local public health officials have reached out to roommates — who have no symptoms — to assist with their quarantine efforts. At this point there is no indication that the student who tested positive was on the core campus recently, except for the visit to UHS for testing. This brings the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases involving Berkeley students or employees to 10, since the first case was reported on Saturday, March 14.</p>

          <div class="well well-sm">
           <strong>Recognizing the challenges to teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Provost and Deans of the University of California, Berkeley adopted the following principle:</strong>
           <h4 class=""><strong>UC Berkeley evaluates applicants for admission to its graduate and professional schools holistically, meaning that we consider an applicant’s combination of personal accomplishments, letters of recommendation, personal statements, academic record, and test scores in making our admissions decisions. Such a review will take into account the significant disruptions of COVID-19 when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials from Spring 2020. We understand that many institutions across the country instituted P/NP grading policies during that semester. Thus, we will not penalize students for the adoption of P/NP and other grading options during this unprecedented period, whether the choices were made by institutions or by individual students. Our admissions evaluation will focus primarily on a student’s academic performance prior to this period, and if applicable, following this period. What is most important is that applicants demonstrate that they pursued a challenging curriculum that was relevant to their plan for graduate or professional school</strong>.</h4>

         <p class="">Two more UC Berkeley students who recently returned from study abroad in Spain have tested positive for COVID-19, campus officials recently learned.</p>
         <p class="">They are both undergraduate students.</p>
         <p class="">One student had studied with the University of California Education Abroad Program in Barcelona, and another student with the UCEAP program in Madrid. Officials with UCEAP have sent letters to program participants and advised them to contact their health provider if they develop symptoms.</p>
         <p class="">University Health Services officials cared for one of the two students and UHS&nbsp; information indicates the student, who lives in the city of Berkeley and is self-isolating in good condition, spent no time on campus while symptomatic and there is unlikely to be any risk to the campus community. The City of Berkeley Public Health Department has been investigating and will reach out to anyone who may have been exposed.</p>
         <p class="">Regarding the second new case, the student is self-isolating outside of Alameda County. Information provided to UCEAP indicates the student was not on the Berkeley campus after returning from Spain. We have few additional details about this case.</p>
         <p class="">To date, we are aware of a total of five confirmed cases where it was reported to us that Berkeley students tested positive for COVID-19. The majority of these cases have been linked to travel from countries with sustained community transmission.</p>
         <p class="">Please keep in mind that our counts are not comprehensive. When confirmed cases involving members of the UC Berkeley community occur outside of UHS or the local area, there may be no confirmation or delayed confirmation of the cases from public health officials to UHS officials. Further, we know that there are likely many more positive cases within our communities that are not yet counted as confirmed positive because the individuals have not been tested.</p>
         <p class="">It is very likely that there are many more positive cases already in our campus community. According to public health officials, once testing becomes more widely available locally and in the region we can expect to see a much higher number of positive cases here and elsewhere. The coronavirus, and community spread, is very much in our Bay Area communities.</p>
         <p class="">Officials at UHS are committed to providing ongoing services in primary care, social services and counseling and psychology to the extent they can during this pandemic.&nbsp; They are developing a number of online and virtual services. Please check the&nbsp;<a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/">University Health Services website</a>&nbsp;if you are a student needing medical or mental health care.</p>

Both are undergraduate students who tested positive after returning home from study abroad. The students are now in isolation at home outside of Alameda County, and in good condition. The students did not return to the Berkeley campus upon return from Spain, so there was no exposure on the Berkeley campus. Although we now have a total of three confirmed positive COVID-19&nbsp; cases involving members of the campus community (the first case was announced last week), we want to make clear that it is very likely that there are many more positive cases already in our campus community.&nbsp; According to public health officials, once testing becomes more widely available locally and in the region we can expect to see a much higher number of positive cases here and elsewhere.

         <p>UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos have <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/13/uc-berkeley-extends-remote-instruction-through-end-of-semester/">announced several updates&nbsp;</a>to UC Berkeley’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19): Remote instruction has been extended through the end of the semester. Students will be able to choose where it is best for them to reside. Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees if they decide to move out. If in-person instruction resumes, in-person course attendance will continue to not be mandatory for the rest of the semester. Supervisors are encouraged to explore work assignments for students to perform remotely. Critical campus functions, including our research enterprise and student support services, remain operational, some with adjusted service hours.</p>
