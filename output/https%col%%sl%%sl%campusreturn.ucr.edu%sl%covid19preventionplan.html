                     <p><strong>UCR has returned to in-person instruction and work.</strong> Following California Department of Public Health and the latest workplace requirements from California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), at UCR:</p>
                     <ul type="circle">
                      <li><strong>Effective Monday, April 11, 2022,</strong> UCR will adjust our guidelines for the use of face coverings to align with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health authorities. On that date the use of face coverings indoors will be strongly recommended for those who are up to date on vaccinations, which includes receiving all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including any booster dose when eligible. Face coverings indoors will remain required for anyone who is not up to date on vaccinations as well as in specific high-risk settings. See face covering section below for more details.</li>

                        <p>UCR also requires routine COVID-19 testing for employees and students. Testing protocols include taking a PCR test at least once every two weeks for vaccinated, asymptomatic students living in campus housing; once every month for all other vaccinated, asymptomatic employees and students who are working or learning on campus; and once a week for anyone who is unvaccinated with an approved exemption. Individuals who are unvaccinated with an approved exemption is required to report by completing the COVID Screening Check.

Individuals will be notified by Human Resources or HR Business Partner and will need to be tested immediately upon notification and again one week later. COVID-19 testing is available at no cost to employees within the exposed group during an employee's paid time, except (a) employees who were not present at the workplace during the relevant 14-day period(s); (b) employees who were fully vaccinated and who do not have COVID-19 symptoms; (c) For COVID-19 cases which do not develop COVID-19 symptoms after returning to work, no testing is required for 90 days after the initial onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, for COVID-19 cases who never developed symptoms, 90 days after the first positive test. Individuals should work with their supervisors to schedule testing times. The duration of any quarantine, isolation, or exclusion period will not be affected by a negative COVID-19 test result. After the first two COVID-19 tests, continuous COVID-19 testing will be required at least once per week at no cost, during paid time for all employees in the exposed group who remain at the workplace, or more frequently if recommended by UCR COVID-19 Management Resource Center, HRBP/Leave Coordinator, Riverside County Department of Public Health.</p>

                         <li>If handwashing facilities are not available, hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethyl alcohol content is a good substitute. Make sure to continue to rub your hands on all surfaces, just as you would if washing until the hand sanitizer has evaporated completely.&nbsp;</li>
                         <li>Avoid touching surfaces like doorknobs and elevator buttons, whenever possible, with bare hands. Use a clean tissue, shirt sleeve, or elbow. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

                        <ul>
                         <li>Maximized outside air to increase air circulation 2 hours before and after regular operating hours, so more fresh air being brought into active buildings</li>
                         <li>Ensuring fan systems are functional and operating.</li>
                         <li>Checking that Central HVAC fan filter efficiencies are maximized and within acceptable operating ranges and replaced as necessary. MERV 13 or better filters are used whenever possible.</li>
                         <li>Conducting an air exchange review of all General Assignment classrooms across campus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a reminder, the most effective way to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus is vaccination. For those that are unable to be vaccinated, the use of a mask, hand washing and physical distancing greatly reduce the potential for infection.<br> There are instances when outside air quantities in naturally or mechanically ventilated spaces cannot be maximized due to environmental conditions. These conditions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>When the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Index is greater than 100 for any pollutant.</li>
                         <li>When the outside air temperature is excessively hot or cold.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a worksite has been identified as the location of a COVID-19 outbreak of 3 or more employee COVID-19 cases within a 14-day period, an investigation into issues concerning insufficient outdoor air or insufficient air filtration will be accomplished. Specific indoor tasks may be moved outdoors or performed remotely if increases in outdoor air or air filtration improvement cannot be accomplished due to ventilation system limitations.<br> When a worksite has been identified as the location of a COVID-19 outbreak of 20 or more employee COVID-19 cases within a 30-day period, indoor locations with mechanical ventilation will be evaluated to determine if filter efficiency can be increased to filters with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher. MERV 13 or higher efficiency filter MERV 13 or higher efficiency filter, then suppose the ventilation system is not compatible with a MERV 13 or higher efficiency filter. In that case, operations within that specific area will be moved to an outdoor location, or the operations will be performed remotely. Portable or mounted High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration units, or other air cleaning systems, will be considered a last resort method to reduce last resort method to reduce transmission risk, where feasible.</p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>Do not use campus or grant funds to purchase HEPA or other air filtration units unless there is specific approval from the UCR Senior Industrial Hygienist. Employees may not bring personal HEPA or other filtration units to campus for use. Any personal units found will be unplugged and will be disposed of within 48 hours if not removed.</li>
