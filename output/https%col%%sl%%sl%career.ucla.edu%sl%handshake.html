          <h3>Where did BruinView go?</h3>
          <p>On May 14, 2018 the UCLA Career Center transitioned from BruinView to Handshake. All currently enrolled UCLA undergraduate, graduate students and alumni with membership information has automatically been moved over into Handshake. Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/218693368-Getting-Started-with-Handshake">"How to Access Handshake"</a>&nbsp;link for more information.</p>
          <h3>Okay. I'm logged in. How do I build my profile?</h3>
          <p>Once you log in, you will be prompted to fill out your profile. You can choose to make your profile visible to employers. We highly recommend you upload a resume and complete your profile so that the most relevant opportunities are pushed to you. Handshake is a dynamic system, so the more information you provide about yourself, the more relevant career opportunities and resources will be. Visit the "For You" tab to see how information is best curated for you.</p>
          <h3>I need to update my profile, because information is incorrect. How can I change it?</h3>
          <p>Pre-populated information in Handshake is updated daily for currently enrolled students from your MyBruin account, which is controlled by the Office of the Registrar. Any changes to your information must be requested through the Registrar. You can update your profile to reflect recent experiences, relevant skills and interests. However, your core profile information including your degree program, email account, and major are all automatically connected through your UCLA record. GPA and citizenship status are not automatically uploaded, but should be accurately represented in any employment application process.</p>
          <h3>How do I make an appointment with a career advisor?</h3>
          <ol>
           <li>Under the&nbsp;Career Center&nbsp;dropdown at the top of your screen, select&nbsp;Appointments</li>
           <li>On the following page, you'll see any past and upcoming appointments you have scheduled. To request a new appointment, click the&nbsp;Schedule a New Appointment&nbsp;button.</li>

           <li>Enter details about the appointment in the&nbsp;What can we help you with?&nbsp;section and then click&nbsp;Request&nbsp;at the bottom of the screen.</li>
           <li>You will be taken to the overview of the appointment where you can cancel or add comments before the appointment.</li>
           <li>Make sure that you check your notifications for updates to the status of your appointment</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>I’m having a hard time scheduling an appointment. What do I do?</h3>

           <li>And more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Career Advising appointment openings are released two&nbsp;weeks in advance. The optimal time to check for new appointment availability is every Friday evening after 5 PM. For any questions regarding Career Advising appointments, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions@career.ucla.edu">questions@career.ucla.edu</a>&nbsp;or access our <a href="https://career.ucla.edu/virtual-desk">Virtual Front Desk</a> (Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm)</p>
          <h3>How do I search for jobs/internships?</h3>
          <p>Start by clicking on&nbsp;Job&nbsp;in the top menu bar. You will be taken to the Job Search page.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/218693408-How-to-Search-for-Jobs-and-Internships">Learn how to filter job/internship opportunities.</a></p>
          <h3>Can I apply for jobs online through the system?</h3>
          <p>Yes, once you have stored your job search documents in Handshake, employers can request that you apply for their jobs directly through Handshake. Each employer will detail which application documents they require (resume, cover letter, etc). You can then retrieve the appropriate materials and submit your application. Employers may also link you directly to their employment sites on their respective websites and request that you apply directly to their internal application systems.</p>
          <h3>I'm being blocked from applying for a job because of my qualifications (Degree Level, Major, etc.), what can I do?</h3>
          <p>The first step is to make sure that your profile is updated with the correct demographic information, such as GPA, grade level, major, etc. Once you check or update your profile, the second step is to thoroughly read through the company's job posting to see what specific qualifications they are looking for. If you do not meet some of the company's qualifications, here are your options:</p>
          <ol>
           <li>Contact the company's recruiter directly to ask clarifying questions regarding their qualifications</li>
           <li>Follow-up with a Career Center staff member</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Can I save a job search and have results e-mailed to me?</h3>
          <p><a href="https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/218693388">Learn how to save job and internship searches and create email alerts.</a></p>
          <h3>How do I connect with employers?</h3>
          <p>Click the&nbsp;Job&nbsp;tab on your homepage. Click the&nbsp;Employer&nbsp;tab to see a full list of employers on Handshake. Filter your search using the criteria at the left side of the page. To learn more about an employer or favorite them, click onto their page.</p>
          <h3>How do I identify fraudulent employers?</h3>
          <p>Fraudulent employers can and do attempt to post job listings on Handshake in order to obtain money or identity information from unsuspecting students. Although the UCLA Career Center staff reviews all new employer accounts to determine that contact information appears valid and job descriptions appear legitimate, some fraudulent parties have succeeded in posting jobs and internships. In order to help safeguard students against potential threats, we are providing the following guidelines.</p>
          <p>If you become suspicious that an employer or contact may be fraudulent, please report this immediately to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions@career.ucla.edu">questions@career.ucla.edu</a>&nbsp;or call the UCLA Career Center's Handshake team at&nbsp;<a href="tel:310-206-1902">310-206-1902</a>.</p>
          <p>When interacting with contacts found in Handshake who present themselves as legitimate employers, please stop all communication and notify the UCLA Career Center team immediately if you experience any of the following:</p>
          <ol>
           <li>A job or internship is offered by phone or email on the spot, with no interview or meeting. (Request to meet with the employer in person at their place of business and confirm before meeting that it is not a residential address)</li>
           <li>The employer contact claims that her or she is out of the country and unavailable to meet, but wants you to start employment immediately. (You should not start work or agree to any task or transaction until meeting with the employer)</li>
           <li>The employer sends you a check and requests that you deposit it into your personal bank account as part of your job duties. (Cease all contact with the employer and do not deposit any check. Please retain any correspondence and provide when reporting to UCLA Career Center staff)</li>
           <li>You are requested to use funds from your bank account to purchase gift cards, gift certificates, or merchandise, and asked to ship purchases to employer address.</li>
           <li>You are asked to provide your social security number, credit card information, or other personal or financial information over the phone or by email.</li>
           <li>The employer is unwilling or unable to provide any background information on their company or declines to provide a verifiable company address or phone number.</li>
           <li>You are asked to purchase products or services.</li>
           <li>You are asked to engage in work activities that appear questionable or illegal.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>After receiving credible and concerning information about an employer's hiring practices, we will launch an immediate investigation and suspend their account and work with appropriate UCLA authorities and/or law enforcement.</p>
          <p><em>For details on privacy practices, please review the&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.nacelink.com/nl_privacy_policy.php">NACElink Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.directemployers.org/privacy/">Direct Employers Privacy Policy</a>.

          <h3>What career resources are available to me and where can they be found?</h3>
          <p>UCLA's Career Center has various subscriptions to organizations like VersatilePhD, Vault, GoinGlobal, InterviewStream, and FOCUS2 that promote professional and career development. Our partner services can be found in the Handshake resources section, so please make sure to click on their links to learn more.</p>
          <h3>I am getting too many Handshake notifications, how do I make them stop?</h3>

          <h2> UCLA Postdoctoral Scholar FAQ </h2>
          <h3>What is Handshake and why would I use it?</h3>
          <p>Handshake is UCLA's online career management platform where employers post jobs, internships, postdocs, and fellowships. This is also where postdocs can sign up for career-related events, info sessions, and recruitment opportunities. Finally, we have curated career-related resources specifically for Postdoctoral Scholars in Handshake.</p>
          <h3>How do I access Handshake?</h3>
          <p>Once your Postdoctoral appointment is confirmed and you are officially hired at UCLA, you can sign up for Handshake. We have pre-loaded your information in Handshake, so you simply need to&nbsp;log in&nbsp;using your UID and password, which should take you through UCLA's multi-factor authentication. From there you can set up your profile and start looking at jobs and resources.</p>
          <h3>What services can I access as Postdoctoral Scholar at UCLA?</h3>
          <p>Postdoctoral scholars at UCLA have access to Handshake, PhD and postdoc specific career events, career fairs, employer information sessions and career resources.</p>
          <h3>As a Postdoc, can I meet with a Graduate Career Advisor?</h3>
          <p>Because Postdoctoral Scholars are employees of the University, they can seek Career advising through Campus Human Resources by emailing Julia Sanchez at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:juliasanchez@chr.ucla.edu">juliasanchez@chr.ucla.edu</a></p>
          <h3>Where else can I find Postdoctoral resources?</h3>
          <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biomedpostdoc.ucla.edu/">David Geffen School of Medicine Office of Postdoctoral Affairs</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/working-at-ucla/postdocs/">UCLA Graduate Division</a>&nbsp;work with Postdoctoral Scholars and can help identify additional resources and offices at UCLA.</p>

          <h3>I've just graduated, can I still use the Career Center?</h3>
          <p>Yes! We are happy to announce that you will now receive three (3) months of continued services after your last academic term. For example, if you graduate in March, you will enjoy the full benefits of the Career Center through June.</p>
          <h3>Do I have to do anything to activate the post-graduation services?</h3>
          <p>No! Your information is coming directly from the Registrar's office and our new Handshake system will continue to recognize your full access services.</p>
          <h3>What are the services I will get in these three (3) months?</h3>
          <p>You are able to use all of the same services of current students including:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Career counseling appointments (via Handshake)</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>I just graduated in June. Is the Career Center open during the summer?</h3>

You will still be able to get career counseling appointments, come by for drop-in counseling, have access to job &amp; internship listings and company site-visits and workshops (though limited during the summer). On-campus interviews, information sessions, career fairs do not normally take place in the summer.</p>
          <h3>My three (3) months are up, what happens now?</h3>
          <p>After your three (3) month grace period, you will get one (1) year of&nbsp;Handshake for Alumni&nbsp;absolutely FREE! That includes access to our online job listings (non-OCR) and entrance to all of our career fairs and networking events. More information can be found on <a href="/alumni">our alumni page</a>.</p>
          <h3>Do I still get access to on-campus interviews?</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, after your three (3) months are completed, you are no longer eligible to participate in on-campus interviews.</p>
          <h3>What is the best way to connect with other UCLA alumni?</h3>
