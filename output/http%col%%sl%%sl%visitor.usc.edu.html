    <p>USC strives to maintain a safe community for its students, faculty, staff, guests and neighbors. From 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night, the number of entrances to the main University Park Campus are limited (for USC Village, the public closure hours are from 10 p.m. - 6 a.m.) Security personnel are stationed at each entrance during these public closure hours; and all persons coming to campus are required to show identification.<br> Guests expected to arrive on campus after 9 p.m. must be pre-registered by a USC student, faculty or staff member; photo ID must be presented at entry. </p> 
    <p>A map of entrances open after public closure hours is available on the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/maps/" target="_blank">USC Maps site </a>.</p> 
    <p><a href="./visitorreg/">Visitor registration </a> is available on this site. Once a USC student, staff or faculty registers a guest, the information is immediately available to entrance attendants. </p> 
    <h3> VISITORS:</h3> 
    <p>Pedestrians wishing to enter campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. must be registered as a guest and have a government issued identification card.</p> 
    <h3>VEHICLES:</h3> 
    <p>Cars with a USC parking permit may be admitted after 9 p.m. to campus parking structures. Registered guests are allowed entry to parking structures after presenting their identification card to entrance attendants. A pass will be issued for registered guests</p> 
    <p>Unregistered visitors driving vehicles will not be allowed entry unless they have a business purpose: examples include commercial food delivery, commercial transportation such as a shuttle van or taxi service, or service calls. Drivers will be asked for identification and for their destination. </p> 
    <h3>SPECIAL EVENTS:</h3> 
    <p>When a university department invites a large number of off-campus guests with expected arrival times between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., arrangements must be made through the USC Department of Public Safety. Guest passes will be created in conjunction with the host department. Student-organized events must be pre-approved and guest arrangements made through USC Student Affairs.</p> 
    <h3>VENDORS:</h3> 
    <p>USC Transportation will issue special passes to regular vendors.</p> <!--
