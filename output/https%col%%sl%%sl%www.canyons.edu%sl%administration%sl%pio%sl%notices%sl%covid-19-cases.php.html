        <p>This graphic charts cases and exposures using Los Angeles County's <a href="#Note">new definition of "close contact."</a> A chart with cases and exposures up to April 15, 2022 and using the prior definition is available <a title="Cases and exposures, March 2020 to April 2022" href="/_resources/images/administration/pio/CHART-COVID-Prior-Definition.png">here</a>. </p>
        <h1><strong>Confirmed Cases</strong></h1>
        <p>The following are confirmed COVID-19 cases members of the campus community have reported to the district. We understand some people want more details, but we must balance this concern with the need, by law, to respect the privacy of those diagnosed. We cannot provide information that would serve to identify any of them.  <span>Per our protocols, we are keeping the campus community informed and notifying the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. </span>In all cases, the district took the following actions: </p>
        <ul>
         <li><span><span>Extensive contact tracing</span></span></li>
         <li><span><span>D</span><span>etermination&nbsp;of&nbsp;exposures to others</span></span></li>
         <li><span><span>Verified that no cases are linked</span></span></li>
         <li><span><span>Provided information to directly affected employees and students</span></span></li>
         <li><span><span>C</span><span>leaning/disinfecting in excess of CDC guidelines</span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In cases where contact tracing showed that members of the campus community were exposed to the virus, the district notified those individuals who were exposed and, as a precaution, sent an email notification to the campus community. Links to the&nbsp;content of those&nbsp;notifications can be found below. </p>
        <p>Please remember to respect people’s privacy. If you have additional information about these cases, please do not share it with anyone as it may be considered a HIPAA violation. Additionally, as a reminder, exposure can happen when a COVID-positive person has close contact with others. <span><a title="Close contact definition" href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/InformationForExposedPersonsCOVID19_Summary.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Close contact</a> is defined as sharing the same indoor airspace with someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period while they were infectious.</span></p>
        <h2><a id="Note">Important Note</a></h2>
        <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has broadened its definition of who is considered a “close contact” of someone confirmed to have COVID-19 and is therefore exposed. Effective April 15, 2022, this revision significantly expands the number of people considered to be exposed, and changes how we report COVID-19 exposures. The monthly cases below that fall under this new definition are denoted with an asterisk (*). <a href="/administration/pio/notices/2022-04-29-exposure-update.php">Read More</a></p>

            <p class="p2"><strong>Update: </strong>Additional testing required by the L.A. County Department of Public Health revealed that one additional employee and six more students were confirmed to have COVID-19, bringing the total of positive cases to 11. Additional contact tracing identified 10 other people who were considered exposed, bringing the total to 15. Those who were confirmed positive will continue to isolate for the required period. Those exposed will either monitor for symptoms or quarantine for the required period. As noted earlier, the affected individuals have not been on campus since Dec. 22. (Updated Dec. 30, 2021) </p>
            <p><strong>Exposure:</strong> 5. An employee and three students who were last in West PE at the Valencia campus on Dec. 22 received positive test results for COVID-19. Contact tracing showed five people were exposed. Because the four positive cases are associated with one another, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health considers this a COVID-19 outbreak. We have notified DPH, as required, and they have asked that those on campus who are considered close contacts (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) of the affected individuals and are not already confirmed to have COVID-19 be tested. That testing occurred Dec. 27. Those who are confirmed positive will continue to isolate for the required period. Those exposed will either monitor for symptoms or quarantine for the required period. </p>

An additional employee was exposed, along with a number of students, so we are conducting additional contact tracing. The employees who tested positive will self-quarantine for the required period, and exposed individuals will either quarantine or monitor for symptoms as appropriate. </p>
