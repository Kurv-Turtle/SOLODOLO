               <p><img src="images/bryan.jpg" class="float-right mb-3 ml-3" alt="Kendall R. Bryan ’88, SM ’89"> I am honored to be nominated for the Alumni Association Selection Committee. MIT alumni are amazing people and have been a big part of my life since I arrived at 77 Mass Ave over 35 years ago. MIT graduates remain my closest friends, especially my MIT wife (Class of 1991)!</p>
               <p>Selecting a diverse and accomplished Board for the Alumni Association is an important responsibility, and I believe I can contribute a valuable perspective. I was fortunate to live and work all across the USA and in several overseas assignments during my professional career in chemical and aerospace manufacturing, including seven years in Germany, five years in China, and five years in England. Knowing incredible people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences has taught me to appreciate diverse qualities in a good leader.</p>
               <p>I am retired from corporate life now and devote the majority of my time to volunteer service, including serving MIT as an educational counselor since the 1990s. In China, I served on the MIT-Shanghai JiaoTong University Leaders for Manufacturing oversight committee with some dedicated MIT professors and staff. I have been active in supporting my fraternity’s MIT chapter for many years, including helping lead a recent $2.5 million fundraising campaign for a major house renovation.</p>
               <p>I am a proud MIT graduate, and I hope you will grant me the opportunity to give back to MIT in a new way by bringing my experiences and perspectives to the AASC. Thank you for your consideration! </p>

               <p><img src="images/chatman-williams.jpg" class="float-right mb-3 ml-3" alt="Angie M. Chatman SM ’88">I grew up on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1960s at a time when my parents were confident that our country would finally embrace all its citizens regardless of race, creed, and gender. That still hasn’t happened; their confidence was misplaced. </p>
               <p>This is due in part to a lack of basic knowledge of the process of scientific inquiry, and the difference between fact and theory.</p>
               <p>I’ve invested my time and talents to support MIT because it is the global leader in educating people about scientific inquiry, and how to apply that process to solving problems. As a Sloan graduate, I’ve used my problem-solving skills in both the business and education sectors. The scientific method is a way of thinking, a useful spade to dig deeper and find the root of any problem.</p>
               <p>As the leader, MIT must continually review its role, and ensure that it’s speaking up and speaking out when the basic tenets of science are threatened. That starts with the Board. I am a candidate for the Alumni Association Selection Committee because I want my voice to be one of those that helps to select those Board members and hold them accountable. </p>

Through riveting discussions with terrific professors and peers from around the world, MIT opened my world view and instilled in me the importance of relationships. Diversity in backgrounds and thought are necessary to develop technology innovations and shape the future.</p>
               <p>For four decades I have actively supported MIT. I served as MIT Club of Washington DC director, and when president provided 60 events annually to encourage MIT alumni involvement. I am active in my MIT class as we encourage relationships and design well-attended enjoyable reunions. I was an actively engaged chair of the MIT Enterprise Forum of Washington–Baltimore, the most active entrepreneurship group in the region. Additionally, I served on the international MIT Enterprise Forum Executive Board, and currently am an MIT Alumni Angels member. With lifelong passion for energy and environmental issues, I am an MIT Energy Initiative affiliate, and am heartened by MIT alumni and students developing solutions to address climate change. As an MIT Corporation Development Committee member for the last eight years, I have helped MIT be financially ready for the future.</p>
               <p>MIT alumni come from all over the world. They are talented, thoughtful, motivated, and continually generating new ideas. If chosen as an Alumni Association Selection Committee member, my hope is to represent all alumni and use my relationships to identify diverse alumni leaders by age, interest, career, and MIT service who will inspire, expand inclusiveness, and offer enriching programs to help MIT graduates stay connected with MIT and with each other for decades to come. </p>

Given the opportunity of a sabbatical from work, I jumped at the chance to return to MIT as a research affiliate for the 2010/11 academic year. As part of the transportation group in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, I worked with graduate students, faculty, and staff, pulling back the curtain on a part of MIT that I was previously unfamiliar with. Living in Simmons Hall as a resident scholar with my wife, I could also take part in the undergraduate experience of my neighbors firsthand and reflect on that of my own 18 years prior. The year of renewing the MIT experience culminated in the MIT 150 celebration and my 15th-year reunion.</p>
               <p>Returning to Germany, I increased my involvement in the Educational Council by taking on the role of regional chair of the area. Interacting with applicants serves as a reminder of the hopes and expectations others have of MIT, as well as the responsibility we have as alumni/ae and a community as a whole in living up to these ideals.</p>
               <p>As a current term member of the MITAA Board of Directors, I am honored to be able to give back to the MIT community while interacting with fellow alums with a rich diversity of backgrounds and MIT experiences. It is this mix that ensures balanced and often critical discussion on the issues at hand and ensures representation of a great spectrum of the alumni/ae body. If elected to the AASC, I would ensure that the future alumni leadership represents the diversity of people and perspectives that make up the MIT community. </p>

               <p><img src="images/grado.jpg" class="float-right mb-3 ml-3" alt="Eduardo Grado ’83"> My first day at MIT, I was hired under the work study student program in the Admissions Office. That position would change my life. After graduation, I joined the admissions staff and eventually became an associate director of admissions and coordinator of minority admissions. With the help of great mentors and colleagues, we would establish programs that would make MIT a leader in the recruitment of women, minority, and first-generation students. </p>
               <p>I loved being an MIT ambassador, visiting communities and meeting thousands of students and parents, and meeting with hundreds of educational counselors and other alumni. The opportunity to inspire young Mexican American and other underrepresented students to achieve their full potential has kept me connected with MIT students and their families, alumni, faculty, and staff. My leadership work with the Avanza Network (Great Dome Award) has helped organize MIT alumni to give motivational talks to over 20,000 students across the US.</p>
               <p>I have spent my career serving on elite admissions selection committees and multiple national scholarship committees, and being a technical and executive recruiter. I continue to stay in contact with many of my classmates and other alumni and network with them to help grow their professional groups. During my career, I have been invited to join MIT alumni helping grow several different international startups. My most recent startup opportunity was recently purchased by Siemens Digital Industries, where I now work with development teams across the globe. </p>
               <p>My desire is to help MIT AASC select the best diverse Board members. </p>

Israel ’86"> The MIT community has been an important part of my life since I first stepped on campus as a freshman. Since graduation, I have remained active with MIT, serving in a variety of capacities including with the Class of 1986, the MIT Club of South Texas, Alumni Association boards and committees, and the MIT Corporation Visiting Committee on Libraries. I started my career as an engineer, then went to law school, and have practiced intellectual property law for over 30 years. I am grateful for the amazing foundation MIT provided and the doors it helped open, and even more grateful for the wonderful MIT community that has become an integral part of my life. I made lifelong friendships as a student and have since met so many impressive alumni from all over the globe. Whenever I get back to campus, I feel energized and proud of our alma mater as an important leader in education, technology, and society and in creating and maintaining a special community like none other.</p>
               <p>I served on the former National Selection Committee and on the Corporation Nominating Committee, and I understand the role and importance of the AASC. If elected, I would carefully consider all viable candidates for leadership positions in the Alumni Association. We are fortunate to have a talented and diverse pool of alumni. I would bring experience, dedication, judgment, and insight to the AASC and would do my best to recommend future leaders who will represent us well. </p>

               <p>MIT was a fascinating four years of discovery and innovation, during which I periodically interned at the MITAA. As a freshman, I taught New Jersey’s young minds through Teach for America before honing my own leadership skills through Leadershape. As a sophomore, I taught technology in China through MIT–CETI. As a junior, I designed manufacturing robots in Japan through the MIT–Japan program. As a course 2 senior, I benchmarked Route 128 corridor manufacturing systems. In 2000, two fellow MIT alums and I cofounded MIT-AITI (now MISTI GSL) to bridge Africa’s digital divide. </p>
               <p>MIT alums formed a core part of my social network while working in Chicago’s technology sector 2000–2006. I returned to Cambridge 2006–2010 and spent time at Harvard learning how global universities are run. Over the entire decade, I served in multiple MIT alum leadership roles, notably within BAMIT, my Class of 2000 Committee, the MIT Club of Chicago, and the MIT Alumni Association. My coleaders and I constantly innovated and pioneered. In recognition, I received the 2010 MITAA Lobdell Award. </p>
               <p>I have spent the past decade back in Africa innovating and settling. Between 2010 and 2012, I supported a fellow MIT alum to cofound an MIT VMS incubated company that still keeps going strong. </p>
               <p>I have maintained membership in the 1861 Circle (now the Annual Giving Loyalty Circle) in gratitude to MIT.</p>
               <p>I desire to bring my unique perspective to the AASC, if elected. </p>

               <p>Throughout my life, I have been an active community volunteer. As a middle schooler, I shelved books in the local library. In high school, I actively participated in Service Club, and I continue to be involved with my high school in local events. While at MIT, I was a class officer, and, post-graduation, I’ve been class secretary for the past 10 years, class president, and a top fundraiser. In the past, I was an EC in the Bay Area. In its inaugural year, I was awarded the Margaret MacVicar Award, along with several other dedicated volunteers. </p>
               <p>During my time as class president, I organized and led several alumni events outside of MIT’s official offerings. I grew engagement with my creative asks for class notes as well as class notes dissemination. I have substantially increased the class Facebook presence with my updates on the physical campus as well as news about my classmates. </p>
               <p>As an older, disabled, female immigrant, I am at the intersection of many forms of diversity, and my mission in life is to help those who live life marginalized by society. It is why I’m currently pursuing an MPP (Master of Public Policy) at the Heller School, located at Brandeis University. Since I currently live in Cambridge, I have been able to keep abreast of recent developments at MIT, and I feel closer than ever to our alma mater. My more than 30 years in the tech, pharma, and retail industries will inform my decisions in the AASC executive selection, recruitment, and assessment processes.</p>
               <p>I believe the AASC should also be reflective of the current student population. As a student and later as a young alum of MIT, I did not see myself in my professors, and certainly not in the alumni. It is my hope to change that by being a role model to those who are just now graduating and those still in school, the young alums of tomorrow. </p>

               <p><img src="images/yeung.jpg" class="float-right mb-3 ml-3" alt="Kenneth Kwokmung Yeung ’88, SM ’89"> As a first-generation college student, MIT unlocked a world beyond me and changed my life. The education I had and the friends and alumni I encountered are an important part of my life. Therefore, I have been giving back to the Institute and the alumni community that has given so much to me by heavily involving myself in the MIT alumni community for the past 15 years.</p>
               <p>I started as Greater China liaison officer in 2007, when I responded to the call for volunteers and later progressed to assuming the role of president of the MIT Club of Hong Kong. As I have traveled weekly between Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan since the early 2000s, I created the Greater China liaison role to help connect all the Greater China clubs, and facilitated the cross-marketing of events and sharing of speakers to alumni of these cities. I also worked with the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in 2010 and established the MISTI Scholarship Fund for Greater China to sponsor student interns in Greater China, with the current balance at around US$200,000. In 2020 March, I acted as a bridge between MITAA and the Greater China clubs in a PPE donation drive to donate N95 respirator masks and medical gowns for MIT Medical Center; our efforts resulted in the Great Dome Award in 2021. </p>
               <p>As the president of the MIT Club of Hong Kong, I have maintained Hong Kong Club as one of the most active international clubs; it was ranked first among all international clubs in 2019 and 2020 for Pi Day 24-Hour Microchallenge. I have also built a strong pipeline of volunteer talents for succession, as our three later club presidents all received MITAA awards, including two Lobdell Awards. </p>
               <p>In 2018, I was elected as an MITAA term director and have served on the Annual Giving Board and Club Council. I am also a board advisor of the MIT Hong Kong Innovation Node, advising on its mission statement and strategy to help drive MIT’s presence in Greater China. </p>
               <p>My array of alumni involvement has given me great exposure to the MIT alumni community: its needs, power, and potential. I am honored to be nominated for the AASC and hope to continue building bridges across our global network for a better world. </p>
