Dream students are not eligible to receive federal financial aid.<br><br> Information within the California Dream Act Application is not shared with federal databases.

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <h4>Award Letters&nbsp;</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">For recently admitted students, estimated financial aid award letters (also known as Financial Aid Offers) will become available during the month of March - roughly about 1-2 weeks after admission decisions are released.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">For current and incoming students, official award letters are released on a rolling basis beginning in in mid-July.</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">Required Documents&nbsp;</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">If a student is selected for the verification process, our office will notify them via their UCSB email. Current students can check their My Aid Status or visit ucsb.verifymyfafsa.com to reveiw any required documents. All students can check ahead of time if they were selected for verification by looking at the summary page of their submitted CADAA. Please note that even if a student was not initially selected for verification, they can be selected for verification after making any corrections to their already submitted CADAA. </p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">Financial Circumstances Changed&nbsp;</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">At times, the income information reported on a student’s California Dream Act Application (CADAA) does not accurately reflect a family’s current financial circumstances. Situations that impact a student and/or family’s ability to contribute to the cost of education can be reevaluated through a Family Contribution Appeal. Please note that these appeals are reviewed on a case by case basis. For more information, please refer to our <a href="https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/appeals">Appeals</a> section of our website.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">*2021-2022 appeals will be available early-mid summer. </p>

       <div class="expcol-content"> 
        <p dir="ltr">The Selective Service System (SSS) allows the federal government to have a list of all young men who would be available to serve in the U.S armed forces if a mandatory draft was necessary. Federal law requires all men between the ages of 18-25 (citizens and undocumented) to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday. A social security number is not required to register.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Do I need to register?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Yes. In order to be eligible to receive state financial aid through the CA Dream Act, men must provide proof of Selective Service registration.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr">Will the Selective Service System disclose my immigration status?&nbsp;</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">The Selective Service System will not disclose your immigration status. The Selective Service System does provide the federal government with your name and address so that the government can contact you in case of a mandatory draft. However, there has not been a mandatory draft since the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr">How do I register?</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Students who do not have a Social Security Number (SSN) or who have been issued a social security number through the DACA program, can register for Selective Service by completing a paper “Selective Service Registration” form. You can access the form on the Selective Service System <a href="https://www.sss.gov/forms/">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Please note that the processing of your registration will take 1-2 months (sometimes longer) so it is important to start the process as soon as possible. Once the registration is successfully processed, the government will mail students their Selective Service Registration card. </p>

        <h3 dir="ltr">UCSB Work-Study</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Similar to the federal work-study, UCSB work-study is awarded to high need students and provides them with the opportunity to work on-campus or off-campus. The program is intended to encourage students to seek part-time employment and reduce the amount of debt incurred while attending college.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Students who participate in the UCSB work-study program will receive the funds in form of a paycheck. UCSB work-study funds will not be paid directly to a student’s billing account.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">This award can only be activated if a student was granted deferred action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and obtained a social security number as well as an employment authorization card.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr">Monarch Opportunity Scholarship</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">The Monarch Opportunity Scholarship is a program designed to help students acquire professional experience. This opportunity is available to Dream Scholars who have not been granted deferred action under DACA.

The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) will award up to $3,000 per academic year (up to $1,500 per semester or up to $1,000 per quarter) to 2,500 eligible students. The grant will be available to the student for up to 8 semesters or up to 12 quarters while they have an active Cal Grant B award. Students must also meet Satisfactory Academic Progress and complete any necessary verification for their Cal Grant B award. <a href="https://www.csac.ca.gov/dsig">https://www.csac.ca.gov/dsig</a></p>
        <h3 dir="ltr">Where can I see my eligibility?&nbsp;</h3>

On their award letters, students will see these opportunities listed as “Professional Experience Opportunity.” In order to determine what program a student can&nbsp; participate in, the student will be prompted to answer a question regarding their work authorization.
