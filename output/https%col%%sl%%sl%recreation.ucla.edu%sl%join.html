          <h4>Participant Expectations</h4> 
          <p>UCLA Recreation believes it is essential that all people exercise their right to express their human and cultural identities. Consistent with this belief, our programs promote healthy lifestyles and the preservation of human dignity by fostering the spirit of fair play without bigotry, hatred, prejudice, or disrespect. We encourage you to join us in acknowledging and embracing these values. Review the <a href="https://dev-ucla-recreation.pantheonsite.io/Portals/41/Documents/Membership/ParticipantExpectations.pdf">UCLA Recreation Participant Expectations</a> prior to accessing our facilities.</p> 
          <h4>COVID Acknowledgement of Risks</h4> 
          <p>Prior to entering any UCLA Recreation venues or participating in any Recreation program (including club and intramural sports), we ask that you fully understand the potential risks associated with contraction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease. Contraction of the virus could cause serious illness or death. For more information, please visit the following resources:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><a href="https://www.bso.ucla.edu/">Bruin Safe Online</a></li> 
           <li><a href="https://covid-19.ucla.edu/">Covid-19 UCLA</a></li> 
           <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">CDC Coronavirus 2019</a></li> 
           <li><a href="https://corona-virus.la/faq">Coronavirus LA FAQ</a></li> 
           <li><a href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/">LA County DPH Coronavirus</a></li> 
           <li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">California COVID-19 Industry Guidance</a></li>
          </ul> 
          <p><br> To help minimize the risk of transmission of the virus within our venues and programs, we have implemented the following safety protocols.</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Surveillance testing and daily health screening for all staff, as well as required face coverings for staff while working and at all times when in the presence of others.</li> 
           <li>Enhanced training for staff regarding public health mitigation measures that must be followed to reduce likelihood of transmission of COVID-19.</li> 
           <li>Posted signage, floor markings, and staff instructions to ensure physical distancing, both within our venues (6 feet) and also while participating in programs (6-10 feet).</li> 
           <li>Reduced venue and program capacity via a reservation process, and also by limiting access to registered students, faculty, and staff who are engaged in active recreation programs or activities.</li> 
           <li>Enhanced disinfecting of high-touch areas and shared equipment.</li> 
           <li>Increased availability of hand sanitizing stations throughout our venues.</li> 
           <li>In venues where it is possible, separate entry and exit points.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p><br> To further minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19, and to abide by current University, County, and/or State guidelines, we will require all individuals entering our venues (including those entering to participate in programs) to:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Only visit with a confirmed reservation or confirmed program registration.</li> 
           <li>Honestly complete a daily Symptom Monitoring Questionnaire and do not enter the campus or facility if not cleared or experiencing a cough, fever, or symptoms of COVID-19. Clearance certificates will be requested prior to entry of any Recreation facility.</li> 
           <li>Abide by physical distancing signs, floor markings, and staff instructions including use of the provided sanitization supplies to sanitize any equipment that you may utilize during your workout.</li> 
           <li>Indoor masking is required for those who are not up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>I understand that no list of restrictions, guidelines, or practices can eliminate the risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. I further understand that I play a crucial role in keeping everyone in the venue and program safer during the pandemic. I understand that failure to do so may result in loss of UCLA Recreation privileges, as well as potential further disciplinary action.</p>
