                    <p>In order to claim the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html">Hope Credit</a>, a student must not have completed the first 2 years of postsecondary education (generally, the freshman and sophomore years of college) as of the beginning of the tax year.

                    <p>Note that the lack of a check mark in this box does not guarantee eligibility for the Hope Credit, which must be claimed within the first two years of postsecondary education.

                   <p>Accounting Services &amp; Controls recommends that for any conference expecting revenue over $10,000, the department should set up a new income account if they do not already have one. This can be done by contacting General Accounting at x2372. If the department currently has an income account, they may use that account to track the conference revenues and expenses, unless the conference is expected to be very large; then the department may elect to set up another income account. General Accounting can provide guidance and assistance in this area.</p>
                   <p>The importance of establishing a new account is to ensure proper tracking and recording the sources and uses of funds - the main principle of fund accounting!</p>
                   <p>As a reminder, some other things to think about when hosting a conference:</p>
                   <p>1. Credit card payments for registration fees. If your department wishes to accept payments using credit cards, you must receive prior approval from the Chancellor. Please contact the campus Credit Card Coordinator in the Controller's Office at x3959. There is a very formal process to getting the approval and the campus Credit Card Coordinator will tell you how to get started.</p>
                   <p>2. Storing the money received. If you will be receiving cash and/or checks for the conference, please refer to Business and Finance Bulletin BUS-49 regarding Cash. This policy includes guidelines for handling, receiving, and storing cash in your department.</p>
                   <p>3. Preparing a budget. This is extremely important. A budget will help you determine what your costs are going to be, how much to charge for the registration fee, and can be a very valuable planning tool.</p>

At UCSB, only Winter quarter registration fees fit into these criteria, because fees are due and payable in December of one tax year for instruction beginning in January of the following tax year. Spring quarter registration fees are never considered "pre-paid," because fees are always due and payable in the same tax year as instruction begins.

                   <p>When the University of California enters into Vendor Agreements, we’re looking at a total savings UC-wide. We’re looking for <strong>Total Cost of Ownership</strong>; which is the pursuit of suppliers that can deliver the best overall value in cost, quality and service over time. The sticker price of a non-catalog item is not always what you can end up paying over time; UCOP Agreement vendors provide warranty, free shipping, returns, and customer service that non-catalog vendors generally do not provide. The UC and all UCOP contract vendors have agreed to and signed common Terms and Conditions to protect us from any unforeseen issues that non-catalog vendors may present – such as no returns, unexpected shipping fees, no warranty, distributor fees, etc.</p>
                   <p>Having catalog items readily available in Gateway with our UCOP Agreement vendors saves time (and therefore money) across the board, rather than spending your time and admin time processing “non-catalog” quotes. While some products in the UCOP Agreements catalogs may be priced higher than you are able to find elsewhere, many of the commonly used products are provided at deep discounts. The UCOP Contracts are negotiated based on bulk and recurring need across all 10 UC campuses. Some products offered at the discounts are due to the fact they are education grade; some other products are offered at retail pricing because they aren’t directly negotiated to be discounted further.</p>

                   <p>It is important to remember that <strong>ALL</strong> animal tissue purchases MUST use the Animal Tissue Form found on the Gateway Homepage. This form routes to our Campus Veterinarian for review and approval.</p>
                   <p>When UCSB investigators contract with other institutions (public or private) to generate custom antibodies, Federal regulations and UCSB IACUC Guidelines require that our IACUC confirm that the other institution has appropriate vertebrate animal procedures and approvals (i.e. PHS Assurance and USDA Registration).</p>
                   <p>Here are some questions to consider when using the Animal Tissue Form:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Does the PHS Policy apply to the production of custom antibodies or to the purchase of surgically modified animals?<br>The generation of custom antibodies is an activity involving vertebrate animals and covered by PHS Policy. Antibodies are considered customized if produced using antigen(s) provided by or at the request of the investigator (i.e., not purchased off-the-shelf). An organization producing custom antibodies for an awardee must have or obtain an Assurance, or be included as a component of the awardee’s Assurance. In addition, the awardee must provide verification of project-specific IACUC approval for the production of the antibodies.</li>
                    <li>Does the PHS Policy apply to use of animal tissue or materials obtained from dead animals?<br>The use of dead animals or parts of animals is not covered by the PHS Policy unless the activity involves (1) killing animals for the purpose of obtaining or using their tissues or other materials, or (2) project-specific antemortem manipulation of animals prior to killing them. If either circumstance is applicable to the acquisition of dead animals, body parts or tissues, prior IACUC protocol review and approval are required.</li>

Backing up your purchase requisition with pricing information such as a quote, email with pricing, or screenshot of website pricing will support and assist if any transactional issues were to arise with invoicing&nbsp;and audits. Here are a list of reasons why obtaining a quote is necessary:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Pricing remains firm for 30 days or more depending what is on the quote, that way the vendor can't increase the pricing.</li>
                    <li>A quote is needed to compare information on the requisition to make sure everything is entered correctly. Ex. Part # or price.</li>
                    <li>A lead time is necessary for the department so they know when to expect the goods.&nbsp; (make sure items are in stock)</li>
                    <li>Who pays for shipping and what are the terms of payment?&nbsp; There are a times when payment is not net 30 and the vendor wants prepayment or 50% down.</li>
                    <li>Warranty information is sometimes listed on the quote which can be helpful if your item breaks down before the warranty period is over.</li>
                    <li>What country the items are coming from can be listed on the quote, which allows&nbsp;the Buyers&nbsp;to add a Customs Broker to the order.</li>

                   <p>A toxin is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms.

                   <p>Toxins are of biological origin. Man-made substances are not toxins. Toxic substances not produced within living organisms are labeled as "toxicants" or "toxics."</p>

                   <p>An Ad-Hoc Approver is <strong>NOT</strong> a required role for your department to assign in your workflow. This is simply a role that you can assign on a case by case basis if you are ever in need of an extra approval or set of eyes on a particular order.</p>
                   <p>The example that we typically give is:<br>Perhaps you have found funds in your budget (go you!) to order all new computers for your department. Besides your usual set of approvals, you really want your incredible IT team to take a look at the order to make sure that everything you are ordering is top notch and right for your team before you buy. You don't need them to look at every order that goes through your department, but this one time-specialty order could really use their expertise. Using the Ad-Hoc feature means that you can simply add in members from your IT team to check out your order and approve it or make suggestions before you finalize the order. This role can be added in the GMC.</p>

                   <p>SHI MCCA renewals require a Purchase Order number and a entry component direct on their webiste. However, submission of a purchase order direct to SHI can cause a duplication of your order, which you will be responsible for the cost. We have created a workaround in order to obtain a purchase order in the system without sending the PO to the supplier. Please follow the instructions below.</p>
                   <p>1. Login to Gateway using your UCSB Net ID</p>
                   <p>2. Select the "non-catalog" item feature from the Home/Shop page</p>
                   <p>3. Select "SHI MCCA" as the supplier (not just SHI!). SHI MCCA is important as that supplier is set to "manual" distribution where your purchase order will not transmit to the supplier when workflow is complete.</p>
                   <p>4. Enter individual line items for the software you are renewing</p>
                   <p>5. Once the Purchase Order is approved, it will not distribute to the supplier, but will still complete and give you a "GW" number to use to renew through the SHI webiste</p>
                   <p>6. Use the "GW" purchase order number to renew via the SHI webiste as instructed</p>
                   <p>7. Print out a copy of the purchase order for your records if needed</p>

                   <p>The Animal Tissue Form should be used for <u><strong>ALL </strong></u>animal tissue purchases that take place in the system.</p>
                   <p>This form will route to the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) on campus for review by our Campus Veterinarian.</p>
                   <p>All fields in bold are required.</p>
                   <p>When UCSB investigators contract with other institutions (public or private) to generate custom antibodies, Federal regulations and UCSB IACUC Guidelines require that our IACUC confirm that the other institution has appropriate vertebrate animal procedures and approvals (i.e. PHS Assurance and USDA Registration).</p>
                   <p>Here are some questions to consider when using the Animal Tissue Form:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Does the PHS Policy apply to the production of custom antibodies or to the purchase of surgically modified animals?<br>The generation of custom antibodies is an activity involving vertebrate animals and covered by PHS Policy. Antibodies are considered customized if produced using antigen(s) provided by or at the request of the investigator (i.e., not purchased off-the-shelf). An organization producing custom antibodies for an awardee must have or obtain an Assurance, or be included as a component of the awardee’s Assurance. In addition, the awardee must provide verification of project-specific IACUC approval for the production of the antibodies.</li>
                    <li>Does the PHS Policy apply to use of animal tissue or materials obtained from dead animals?<br>The use of dead animals or parts of animals is not covered by the PHS Policy unless the activity involves (1) killing animals for the purpose of obtaining or using their tissues or other materials, or (2) project-specific antemortem manipulation of animals prior to killing them. If either circumstance is applicable to the acquisition of dead animals, body parts or tissues, prior IACUC protocol review and approval are required.</li>

                   <p>Generally speaking, FlexCard and Gateway are two separate purchasing processes.</p>
                   <p>The only time that they two processes intermingle is when a FlexCard transaction requires a purchase order as back-up in order to raise a limit on a card or to purchase a restricted item.</p>
                   <p>You can create a purchase order in the system using the FlexCard Authorization Form. Instructions for use of the form can be found by <a href="/files/docs/procurement/Gateway%20Flexcard%20Authorization%20Form.pdf">clicking here</a>.</p>
                   <p>This form will go through your departmental approval process and will then route to the FlexCard Team to raise your limit or to approve of the restricted item.</p>
                   <p>Once they approve, you will get a purchase order number to confirm that your limit has been raised or your restricted item has been approved.</p>
                   <p>The FlexCard purchase order begins with an "F" rather than a "GW" and automatically closes so that invoices cannot pay against it.</p>

                   <p>The first step is check to make sure there are no outstanding payments. To do this go to “Document Search” and select Purchase Order. In the section labeled “Custom Fields” enter the LAF you are a looking to disable. Click go. Gateway will return search results for all PO’s issued on that account string. Under “Settlement Status” you want to see “Fully Received, Fully Invoiced, Fully Matched”.</p>
                   <p><strong>If all of the Purchase Orders have been fully invoiced (and all of the invoices have been processed and completed); you will take the following steps:</strong></p>
                   <p>In the Gateway Management Console (GMC) go to “Accounts” and “Manage Account Strings”. Search for the LAF that you would like to disable. Once you locate it, under the “actions” tab click “Disable”. This will remove the LAF from Gateway.</p>
                   <p><strong>If your Purchase Order still has “pending invoices” or purchase orders that that have not been invoiced, then you will need to take the following steps:</strong></p>
                   <p>In the GMC you will access the “Assignments” tab and “Manage Assignments”. Search for the “LAF” for the expired award. In the actions tab click “Unassign” next to all Account Approvers assigned to approve on the LAF. This will keep your LAF active in Gateway to process all of the pending invoices authorized on the PO, but it will disable the LAF from being used on shopping carts and purchase requisitions so that additional orders are not placed on expired awards. Once all invoices have processed against the expired award, then you can follow the steps above to disable the LAF to remove it completely from Gateway.</p>

                   <p>There are two ways to search Gateway for a particular good or service.</p>
                   <p>1. You can search for suppliers by using a "keyword search" in the supplier's profile. The following categories were identified as frequently searched or requested, so these are the only categories UCSB Gateway currently has. That said, if you don't see the category you need, proceed to #2 below.</p>
                   <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Transportation and Charter</li>
                    <li>Sequencing, Reagents, and Antibodies</li>
                    <li>Wafers</li>
                    <li>Furniture</li>
                    <li>Copiers</li>
                    <li>Printing</li>
                    <li>Toner</li>
                    <li>Advertising and Marketing</li>
                    <li>Animal Research</li>

                    <li>Website Design</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>To search by these keywords:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>login to Gateway</li>
                    <li>once on the homepage, locate the "Supplier Search" green section in the middle of the screen, about half-way down</li>
                    <li>click on "Advanced Search"</li>
                    <li>expand the section called "Products/Services"</li>
                    <li>type in one of the above listed categories into the field for "Keywords"</li>
                    <li>click Search</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Another way to locate vendors in Gateway that provide the categories you are looking for:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Search previous orders from the entire campus.</li>
                    <li>Click on Documents in the far left column in Gateway.</li>
                    <li>Then navigate to Document Search, and click on Search Documents.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you are in the "Advanced Search" function, then make sure the Search dropdown is selected to "Requisitions".</li>
                    <li>Finally, type in your commodity/category or keyword into "Product Description" and click Search.</li>
                    <li>You should now see a list of orders the campus has processed, and the suppliers listed in the second row.</li>

                   <h3>Guidelines for UCSB Agency Accounts<br><em>UC Policy Business Financial Bulletin A-54</em></h3>
                   <h4>Overview</h4>
                   <p>This local procedure on agency accounts is UCSB’s guidelines to implement BFB A-54, which has been UC Policy on agency accounts since October 15, 1987. This local guideline was needed to clarify and provide instruction to UC Santa Barbara for establishing and managing agency accounts. Agency accounts are set up by UCSB’s General Accounting team for non-university entities - these are not UCSB revenues nor expenditures. Agency accounts are used if the university does not have ownership of the funds.&nbsp; The financial activity of the agency accounts is reported in accordance with Government Accounting Standards Board pronouncement 84, Fiduciary Activities (GASB 84).</p>
                   <h3>Guidelines &amp; Process</h3>
                   <p><strong>What is an Agency Account?&nbsp;</strong> Agency accounts are established by UCSB for non-UCSB entities. The activity must provide benefits to the university community. The university acts as a custodial or fiscal agent. The university does not exercise any direct financial control over the use of the funds. At fiscal year-end, expense and revenue transactions on agency accounts are excluded from university income statements, and agency account balances are reclassified on the balance sheet as a current asset or a current liability.</p>
                   <p><strong>How to Establish an Agency Account:</strong>&nbsp; The outside agency must coordinate with a sponsoring campus department to establish an agency account. To establish a new agency account, the outside agency must provide a completed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZzsFOHdmbuFEp6zFwfYJqVHMvqN2n_eU/view?usp=sharing">Agency Account Request Form</a> to General Accounting, including:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>The name of the agency</li>
                    <li>The primary contact person(s) for the agency</li>
                    <li>The purpose of the agency account, including benefit to the university community</li>
                    <li>The nature of cash receipts and disbursements anticipated on the agency account</li>
                    <li>Which sponsoring campus department/contact person will be acting as fiscal agent for the agency account</li>
                    <li>Agency, sponsoring department, and control point approval signatures</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>Depending on the level of services provided to the agency, the university may charge the agency an administrative fee for the cost of services (purchasing, payment of invoices, etc.) provided as a part of the agency agreement. General Accounting will approve and maintain the forms and set up the account. These accounts will be set up as non-reportable expenditure accounts in the 80xxxx account series.</p>
                   <p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities of Approved Agency Account Holders:</strong></p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Complete Signature Authorization forms (found in Data Warehouse) to document who has the authority to process agency account transactions, and follow campus policy notifying BFS whenever authorized signers change in order to update signature authorizations.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a positive account balance, depositing funds as needed to cover overdrafts in a timely manner, and no later than fiscal close each year.</li>
                    <li>Review disbursements for appropriateness and maintain compliance with applicable UC Policy, federal, state, and local laws.</li>
                    <li>Notify General Accounting to close the agency account once no future activity is anticipated. Any credit balance remaining in the fund will be refunded to the agency or, if the agency no longer exists, transferred to the Chancellor’s campus-wide miscellaneous income account. If a deficit in the fund cannot be recovered from the agency, it will be charged to the department sponsoring the agency account.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p><strong>Services Provided for Agency Accounts:</strong> The University provides normal administration of cash receipts and disbursement services for agency accounts, except for payroll disbursements and Gateway procurement services.</p>
                   <p>Agencies with agency accounts may also make use of campus recharge operations and service departments. Agency accounts are charged the same recharge rates as UCSB users for these services. Note that because these funds belong to outside entities, amounts recharged to agency accounts should not credit the recharging department’s expense account with recharge credit object code 3900, but should instead credit the recharging department’s income account.</p>
                   <p>Note that checks for deposit to an agency account should still be made payable to UC Regents, as these deposits are processed using university bank accounts.</p>
                   <p>Agency funds do not have campus budget appropriations, therefore budget journals and Transfers of Funds cannot be processed on agency account-funds.</p>
                   <h3>Additional Information &amp; Background</h3>
                   <p>It's important to note that BFB A-54 specifically excludes the <strong>Associated Students</strong> organizations from UC agency accounting, as these are UC entities. "The Regents at their May 18, 1972 meeting reaffirmed that the, 'Associated Students in the several campuses of the university are official units of the university.'" Accordingly, at UCSB, Associated Students is included in our General Ledger. They operate as a separate department and they manage some UC fees separately with their own bank account, however their financial activity is included in UCSB’s consolidated financial reporting.</p>
                   <p>Funds accepted for an agency account are not tax deductible charitable contributions to the University.</p>
                   <p>UCSB established these guidelines for agency accounts to minimize the risk of financial exposure to the university resulting from an agency account holder’s inability to pay.&nbsp; General Accounting periodically audits agency accounts for compliance, evaluating the convenience of keeping the cooperation with the agency, or the cancellation of the relationship.</p>

                   <p>This is a dilemma! However you do have some options. The University Travel Policy (Business and Finance Bulletin G-28) states that reimbursement should be for actual costs only. This policy follows IRS regulations, limiting reimbursements to actual expenditures.</p>
                   <p>When meeting with the P.I., be prepared to show him/her the policy and explain why you are unable to reimburse the student for the full amount. If you are concerned about talking with the P.I., consider talking to your department MSO or department chair. You can also contact the Travel unit in Accounting, or our office if you need more guidance in understanding and interpreting the policy.</p>
                   <p>To preclude this type of situation in the future, here are some additional options:</p>
                   <p>1. Explain to the traveler prior to the trip, the reimbursement policy and the receipt documentation needed. If your department has an email distribution list, perhaps send out the policy information to all faculty and staff.</p>
                   <p>2. Provide travelers with a "Traveler Worksheet" which gives the traveler an area to record their daily meal expenditures and explains the meals and incidental expenses rule. (The Travel Unit in Accounting has samples of "Traveler Worksheets.")</p>
                   <p>3. If the traveler still claims the full amount, and certifies or signs that the voucher is an accurate recording of expenses, then the responsibility lies with the traveler and authorizing signature.</p>

                  <div class="field-content">
                   <p>There are several issues you want to think about before making the software purchase.</p>
                   <p>1. Purchasing Policy #5330 (Currently Under Review) states: "University credit, purchasing power, and facilities may not be used to purchase goods or services for non-University purposes." By making personal purchases, the University contract for the software prices is at risk.</p>
                   <p>2. If you make the purchase for the staff member, consider how are you going to get the money back to reimburse the department? What if the person leaves?</p>
                   <p>3. Confirm with the staff member that this software will not be used for ANY work-related purpose. If some work will be done using the software, then this purchase would be ok and the staff member would not be required to reimburse the department.</p>
                   <p>In all cases, you want to be able to explain the Purchasing policy. In our experience, just saying "NO" creates more aggravation and frustration. Many times there is a lack of knowledge that a specific policy exists and the situation just needs to be ex plained.</p>

                   <p>Although these funds are “discretionary,” these funds are still the property of the UC Regents and fall under university policies and guidelines. As such, there are a number of issues surrounding payroll and hiring an employee, regardless of the funding source.</p>
                   <p>It is not ok to pay an employee with personal funds prior to the employee being hired in the Payroll Personnel System (PPS) for a number of reasons:</p>
                   <p>1) Upon hiring an employee for the university, certain forms are required to be completed prior to employment, such as the I-9, and the State Oath and Patent Agreement. The department and the university can be held liable if these forms are not completed.</p>
                   <p>2) Liability – What would happen if the employee is injured during the time he/she is not in the official payroll system? The employee would not be covered under the University’s Workers’ Compensation policy. The faculty member would then be liable for any injuries resulting to the employee or even potentially a 3rd party.</p>
                   <p>3) Benefits – If the graduate student is eligible for Graduate Student Fee Remission, this benefit would not be calculated correctly, resulting in the student having to pay all of their fees. In addition, if a graduate student is going to work over 50%, they will need to have an exception approved by the department.</p>
                   <p>4) Tax Reporting – The appropriate amount of taxes may not be withheld and/or reported.</p>
                   <p>5) Funding Source – What if the student has work study funds? His/her efforts would not be reported correctly under the federal work study program and could jeopardize the program for the entire campus.</p>
                   <p>If in fact, the professor needs to hire someone before the disbursement of money (such as a contract, grant, or other funds that won’t be disbursed right away), the professor can use the OR Form 203, “Request for Approval to Spend Funds” (RAS). In addition, certain gift funds may only be distributed once or twice a year, so depending on the time of year, the professor could be waiting a long time for reimbursement.</p>

                   <p>In this situation, there are a couple of options. One, you could remind the employees of their need to reimburse the university for their personal calls and encourage the staff to use a personal cell phone, or a long distance calling card if they need to continue making these types of calls. In addition, if the personal long distance calls continue, you could work with Communications Services to block out-going long distance calls from those phones.</p>
                   <p>If they continue to choose not to reimburse the university, then the amount needed to cover the costs could be considered compensation and reported on their W-2 at the end of the year.</p>
                   <p>Productivity should also be a concern if the employees are spending work time on the phone. Employees should utilize their break time or their lunch period for personal calls.</p>

                 <div class="views-field views-field-body"> 
                  <div class="field-content">
                   <p>This question involves several issues:</p>
                   <p>1) Having food at an office meeting<br>2) Using petty cash to purchase food<br>3) Purchasing food from Costco</p>
                   <p><b>Issue #1:</b><br>If food is provided at an office meeting, the meeting/food for the event needs to be consistent with the <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420364/BFB-BUS-79" target="_blank">UC Entertainment policy</a>. In this case, policy does allow light refreshments for recognition of service. A <a href="/files/forms/ap-payment-request-f5ent.pdf">Payment Request for Business Meetings and Entertainment</a> needs to be completed and approved in accordance with the policy (see <a href="/files/forms/travel-payment-request-instructions.pdf">instructions</a>).</p>
                   <p><b>Issue #2:</b><br>It is never appropriate to use petty cash funds to purchase food. Petty cash funds are meant to provide for the purchase of certain low value items <b>other</b> than food. If an employee uses their own funds to purchase food and is approved for reimburs ement, a <a href="/files/forms/ap-payment-request-f5ent.pdf">Payment Request for Business Meetings and Entertainment</a> should be used. (Please refer to the campus Petty Cash Policy for additional information.)</p>
                   <p><b>Issue #3:</b><br>The <a href="http://www.policy.ucsb.edu/policies/policy-docs/food.pdf">Campus Food Policy</a> states that University Center (UCEN) Catering, Residential Dining Special Events Catering, or the Faculty Club are the primary sources for al l food provided on campus. However, if none of the campus caterers are able to provide service for your event, the UCEN Catering Manager has a list of approved vendors that you may select as an alternate provider. These vendors have been approved becaus e they have the appropriate food and health permits and have the correct amount of liability insurance according to Business Services. Using a vendor not on the approved list subjects the University to liability and puts the department and employees at r isk - for among other things, accidental food poisoning!</p>
                   <p>The Campus Food Policy does allow the following:</p>
                   <p>"<b>Individuals</b> may provide light refreshments for meetings or have potlucks for department gatherings only when basic sanitary practices and campus and industry health standards are met. The Health and Safety Code may be obtained from Environmental Health and Safety."</p>
                   <p>Although using Costco can sometimes result in a financial savings to a department, there are other costs involved. Think about the time it takes for an employee to go to Costco and return to work, approximately 30 minutes to one hour. Everyone's time is valuable - is the department really saving money by not using a campus caterer? Second, what if an employee is injured during the trip to Costco, or gets into an accident? Just think about these additional costs/risks when making the decision to use ou tside caterers or to buy the food from a vendor such as Costco. Remember, if a department does choose to buy from Costco, the employee is reimbursed via a Miscellaneous Form -5, as described above in Issue #2.</p>

                   <p>SAS 115 (formerly SAS 112) changes the process for evaluating deficiencies that come to auditors’ attention and brings the thresholds for reporting control deficiencies in line with the thresholds required for public companies. As these revised thresholds effectively lower the bar, it is expected that the reporting of what are now defined as either significant deficiencies or material weaknesses will be become increasingly more prevalent. There is a possibility that items not previously identified as control deficiencies could rise to what has now been defined as a significant deficiency or a material weakness simply as a result of imposing a new definition on the auditor, not as a result of any deterioration in the University’s system of internal control. The materiality of the control deficiency is determined based on what potentially could go wrong, not just on the amount of actual misstatements.</p>

                   <p><strong>EXEMPT EMPLOYEES</strong><br>The workweek for full-time exempt employees is normally considered to be 40 hours, and for part-time employees the proportion of 40 hours equivalent to the appointment percentage; however, greater emphasis is placed on meeting the responsibilities assigned to the position than on working a specified number of hours. <strong>Exempt employees do not receive overtime compensation or compensatory time off, or additional compensation beyond the established salary for the position</strong> except as provided in Staff Policy 30.I, Administrative Stipend for Temporary Assignments.</p>

If you have a maintenance contract with Xerox, Ricoh, or Canon, no other company is authorized to tell you your warranty is void or agreement will expire unless you buy their toner. In addition, some vendors have been sending unsolicited toner cartridges to departments, then invoicing and expecting payment. Please do not use these toner packages.

                   <p>When the University of California enters into Vendor Agreements, we’re looking at a total savings UC-wide. We’re looking for Total Cost of Ownership; which is the pursuit of suppliers that can deliver the best overall value in cost, quality and service over time. The sticker price of a non-catalog item is not always what you can end up paying over time; UCOP Agreement vendors provide warranty, free shipping, returns, and customer service that non-catalog vendors generally do not provide. The UC and all UCOP contract vendors have agreed to and signed common Terms and Conditions to protect us from any unforeseen issues that non-catalog vendors may present – such as no returns, unexpected shipping fees, no warranty, distributor fees, etc.</p>
                   <p>Having catalog items readily available in Gateway with our UCOP Agreement vendors saves time (and therefore money) across the board, rather than spending your time and admin time processing “non-catalog” quotes. While some products in the UCOP Agreements catalogs may be priced higher than you are able to find elsewhere, many of the commonly used products are provided at deep discounts. The UCOP Contracts are negotiated based on bulk and recurring need across all 10 UC campuses. Some products offered at the discounts are due to the fact they are education grade; some other products are offered at retail pricing because they aren’t directly negotiated to be discounted further.</p>

It consists of the preservation, but not the improvement of buildings and grounds. Maintenance is generally on a routine or recurring basis, and may be to bring equipment back to a fully functional state.

                   <p><i>It is the policy of the University of California that its officers and employees shall comply with the provisions of state and federal law governing the acceptance of gifts and gratuities. In addition to compliance with the requirements of law, University officers and employees must avoid the appearance of favoritism in all of their dealings on behalf of the University. All University officers and employees are expected to act with integrity and good judgment and to recognize that the acceptance of personal gifts from those doing business or seeking to do business with the University, even when lawful, may give rise to legitimate concerns about favoritism depending on the circumstances. </i></p>
                   <p>Gifts include meals, tickets, travel, and discounts given by vendor reps for personal items unrelated to the University business. <span style="color: rgb(26, 25, 26);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The term gift or gratuity does not include&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgb(26, 25, 26);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">information materials such as books, reports, pamphlets, calendars, </span></span><span style="color: rgb(26, 25, 26);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">periodicals, or other unsolicited promotional material. </span></span></p>

                   <p>While we don't have a systemwide contract with Costco, Walk-In Purchase Orders are accepted at the local store<strong> for goods </strong>(Memberships are <strong>not </strong>paid with a Purchase Order; see below for details) with the following procedures:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Visit the Membership Counter prior to shopping. Costco will require your department have a Business Membership. To set that up, Costco may require paper documentation proving you work for the UC (that could be in the form of a paystub, website print-out, or directory listing), and may require to see your Driver's License to prove you are who you say you are. Cards may be issued to the indivudal names, not the UC department.</li>

                    <li><strong>UCSB limits the membership to the Business</strong> card priced at $55. Executive Memberships are NOT allowed, and Costco no longer provides "Corporate" accounts. These will be standard accounts that are just paid by UCSB.</li>
                    <li>Memberships are restricted to up to 6 cards per account. Each $55 includes just 2 cards.</li>
                    <li>Once you have the membership, you may execute Walk-In PO's in Gateway.</li>
                    <li>Take your printed out Walk-In PO to the Membership counter, and walk away with your product(s). Costco will provide you with an Invoice, that you would send over to Accounts Payable.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>To pay invoices, please write your Gateway Walk-In PO # on the invoice, and send the product invoices to <a href="mailto:invoicesONLY@bfs.ucsb.edu">invoicesONLY@bfs.ucsb.edu</a>.<br>Membership invoices ($55) cannot be paid on a purchase order, but should be processed on a Membership Form 5 directly to Accounts Payable.

                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">Certain University hosted or sponsored events may include alcohol, but be aware of some strict rules around serving and buying alcohol.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.008px;">The university's use of funds for entertainment must be compatible with our stewardship responsibility and must have a strong ethical component.&nbsp;<strong>We should be able to show that our entertainment expenses are&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">necessary and in the best interest of the public</em><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">.</span></strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">Here are some common questions:</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>What funds can be used to pay for alcohol?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- Federal and State funds cannot be used to pay for alcohol. Generally gift (or opportunity) funds can be used. Check with Accounting to see which of your department accounts may be used.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Who can serve alcohol at our UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- The best option is to hire a catering company with an ABC license to serve. All servers must be ABC certified, be 18 or over if serving alcohol is incidental to the overall services (such as serving food), while bartenders strictly serving drinks must be 21 and over. Anyone serving cannot consume alcohol while working the event.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(65, 75, 104); font-family: Lato, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">An excellent way to reduce the risk exposure that alcohol consumption creates for the University is to transfer the responsibility of providing and serving the alcohol to a licensed and insured hotel, restaurant, or caterer.&nbsp;</span></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Can we use UC students to serve alcohol at our UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Is the campus ABC certified?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No; the UC is not ABC certified, and does not have an campus-wide alcohol license. While certain single-use permits can be granted by the Chancellor, such events must meet the mission of the University and be planned and approved well in advance.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Can we sell alcohol at a UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No; this is outside the mission of the University and not allowed. Note, UC-operated food facilities (such as The Club) do have a limited liquor license.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Is UC insured for liquor liability?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- Not typically or automatically; please check with Risk Management for further questions.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Anything more I should know about selling or serving alcohol on campus or at a UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- Yes! There are more rules for serving alcohol here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/riskmanagement/use-alcohol" style="font-size: 13.008px;">https://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/riskmanagement/use-alcohol</a></p>

                   <p>If the order stops in Procurement, including Equipment Management (i.e. a restricted commodity, using federal funds, inventorial equipment, and/or is a non-catalog order over $9,999.99),&nbsp;a quote is required.&nbsp;Procurement Services&nbsp;requires proof of pricing, whether it be on a quote, email from the vendor, or screenshot of a marketbasket with a timestamp. Backing up your purchase requisition with pricing information such as a quote, email with pricing, or screenshot of website pricing will support and assist if any transactional issues were to arise with invoicing&nbsp;and audits. Here are a list of reasons why obtaining a quote is necessary:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Pricing remains firm for 30 days or more depending what is on the quote, that way the vendor can't increase the pricing.</li>
                    <li>A quote is needed to compare information on the requisition to make sure everything is entered correctly. Ex. Part # or price.</li>
                    <li>A lead time is necessary for the department so they know when to expect the goods.&nbsp; (make sure items are in stock)</li>
                    <li>Who pays for shipping and what are the terms of payment?&nbsp; There are a times when payment is not net 30 and the vendor wants prepayment or 50% down.</li>
                    <li>Warranty information is sometimes listed on the quote which can be helpful if your item breaks down before the warranty period is over.</li>
                    <li>What country the items are coming from can be listed on the quote, which allows&nbsp;the Buyers&nbsp;to add a Customs Broker to the order.</li>

                   <p><strong>DOMESTIC:</strong><br>Risk Management no longer requires prior approval to insure all domestic orders exceeding $100,000.&nbsp; The entire amount of a purchase exceeding $100,000 <u>can</u> be covered by the UC's insurance during transit, but a conversation should be held with Risk Managment <u>for each purchase</u> to address the shipment details, and to allow Risk to provide further recommendations. For example, Risk might recommed that a receipt signature be required, rather than FedEx/UPS "dropping" the box off at a door.</p>
                   <p>Procurement will work with your department on international purchases, and domestic purchases exceeding $100,000 to ensure Risk Management is roped in. A proactive approach is appreciated, however, by including a copy of an email between your department and Risk with the determination.

                   <p><strong>INTERNATIONAL:</strong><br>For international orders, if the vendor is paying for all transportation and insurance charges, AND is the Importer on Record through Customs, then the department does not need to apply for transit risk insurance. If, however, the UC is paying for all transportation charges, AND your purchase exceeds $1,000.00, then your department will need to apply for Transit Risk Insurance: <a href="http://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/files/docs/rm/ApplicForeignTransInsur.pdf">http://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/files/docs/rm/ApplicForeignTransInsur.pdf </a>(Note, there is a $1,000 deductible on claims.)<br>&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Sometimes external agencies ask University personnel to perform services related to that external agency's research. These services may appear to be research-related, so it's important to peel apart the scope of work and ensure we can indeed enter into the relationship as a "Contractor", rather than a Subawardee.</p>
                   <p>The Uniform Guidance (200.87) defines Research and Development as follows:</p>
                   <p><span style="font-style:italic">R&amp;D</span> means all research activities, both basic and applied, and all development activities that are performed by non-Federal entities. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.</p>
                   <p>“Research” is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes.</p>
                   <p>UC defines research as follows:</p>
                   <p style="margin-left:9.0pt;"><em>The majority of the scope of work involves investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, the revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or the practical application of such new or revised theories or laws.&nbsp;University personnel are involved in decisions regarding the design or implementation of the research and/or the interpretation of the research results. University personnel are credited as authors on papers that emerge from the research. The work carried out by University personnel may (but need not) result in patentable or copyrightable technology or products.&nbsp; May be applied or basic research.</em></p>

If the total amount of the acquisition exceeds the microcap threshold (currently set at $3,499.99), you will need to enter a standard purchase order requisition in Gateway. Due to federal regulations for contract and grant awards, the UC is required to flow-down certain contract provisions to the vendor. As a result, every vendor we need to use for federal purchases over the microcap threshold will need to be vendored into Gateway.</p>

                   <p>Security systems, including door alarm and surveillance cameras are restricted, and cannot be procured solely on the FlexCard. Cameras installed on UC property create significant risk exposure to the campus, and do require multiple campus approvals before an order can be released. Below are some of the examples of the process we go through after having received a requisition in Gateway:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Notify Human Resources; cameras recording any UC employee require at least a 45-day notice period to employee unions before the cameras can be activated. (Note: the purchase and installation can be completed before the Notice term is over, but your department may risk losing these costs on the off chance the Union protests the installation.)</li>
                    <li>Work with Design and Construction; some camera installations are categorized as construction, rather than maintenance. We may need to bifurcate the purchase; and remove the installation portion from the requisition</li>
                    <li>Communicate with Enterprise Technology Solutions; who currently offers a central video security service which may be suitable for your needs.&nbsp; A potential advantage in the ETS offering is it will evolve to keep in compliance with campus requirements.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>When we receive a requisition for cameras in Purchasing, we will ask the end users a series of questions, including the number of cameras, the subject matter of the cameras, which party is responsible for hosting the video feed, who will be monitoring and have access to the video feed, and whether or not the cameras are a direct replacement, or a new system or new a subject matter.</p>
                   <p>A formal policy for Surveillance Camera Systems will be announced sometime next year, which will articulate the procedures for requesting approval of the installation and procurement of security cameras on UC property. In the meantime, any questions prior to submitting a Gateway requisition for security or surveillance cameras should be sent to <a href="mailto:contracts@bfs.ucsb.edu">contracts@bfs.ucsb.edu</a></p>

                    <li>Visit the Membership Counter prior to shopping. Costco will require your department have a Business Membership.

                    <li>Once you have the membership, you may execute Walk-In PO's in Gateway.</li>
                    <li>Take your printed out Walk-In PO to the Membership counter, and walk away with your product(s). Costco will provide you with an Invoice, that you would send over to Accounts Payable.</li>

                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">Certain University hosted or sponsored events may include alcohol, but be aware of some strict rules around serving and buying alcohol.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.008px;">The university's use of funds for entertainment must be compatible with our stewardship responsibility and must have a strong ethical component.&nbsp;<strong>We should be able to show that our entertainment expenses are&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">necessary and in the best interest of the public</em><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">.</span></strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">Here are some common questions:</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>What funds can be used to pay for alcohol?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- Federal and State funds cannot be used to pay for alcohol. Generally gift (or opportunity) funds can be used. Check with Accounting to see which of your department accounts may be used.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Who can serve alcohol at our UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- The best option is to hire a catering company with an ABC license to serve. All servers must be ABC certified, be 18 or over if serving alcohol is incidental to the overall services (such as serving food), while bartenders strictly serving drinks must be 21 and over. Anyone serving cannot consume alcohol while working the event.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(65, 75, 104); font-family: Lato, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">An excellent way to reduce the risk exposure that alcohol consumption creates for the University is to transfer the responsibility of providing and serving the alcohol to a licensed and insured hotel, restaurant, or caterer.&nbsp;</span></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Can we use UC students to serve alcohol at our UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Is the campus ABC certified?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No; the UC is not ABC certified, and does not have an campus-wide alcohol license. While certain single-use permits can be granted by the Chancellor, such events must meet the mission of the University and be planned and approved well in advance.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Can we sell alcohol at a UC event?</strong></p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;">- No; this is outside the mission of the University and not allowed. Note, UC-operated food facilities (such as The Club) do have a limited liquor license.</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 13.008px;"><strong>Is UC insured for liquor liability?</strong></p>

                   <p>Many campuses have been receiving requests from employees for reimbursements of meal expenses associated with working from home during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place. It is important to remember that employees who are working from home are not on travel status as defined in <a class="ext" href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420365/BFB-G-28">Business and Finance Bulletin G-28, Travel Regulations</a>, as “the period during which a traveler is traveling on official University business outside the vicinity of their headquarters or residence.” Because employees who are working from home are not on travel status, they are not eligible for meal reimbursement.</p>
                   <p>Similarly, requests for reimbursement of meals taken at home (or delivered) during a Zoom business meeting or employee morale event are not reimbursable under policy. Per <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420364/BFB-BUS-79">Business and Finance Bulletin BUS-79</a>, a business meeting requires an in-person host, and is intended for on-premises and/or in-person meetings of employees. None of those factors would occur, for example, if an employee is reimbursed or provided a meal for consumption at their own home during a Zoom meeting or event with colleagues.</p>
                   <p>Campuses can reimburse or provide meals for non-employees that are associated with on-line donor cultivation events. Similarly, campuses can provide a meal to a non-employee guest who is attending a University-sponsored meeting or event. And, students who are not employees and participating in a remote student-related programmatic activity can be provided a meal voucher if attending the on-line event. Campuses have the discretion whether to provide meal gift cards in these situations.</p>

                   <p>The following excerpts from <a class="offsite" href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420365/BFB-G-28">UC Policy G-28, Travel Regulations</a>, outline the requirements for the Authorizing Signature.</p>
                   <p><strong>A. Approval of Travel Expense Claim (G-28 pp 8)</strong></p>
                   <p><em>"The authority to approve travel expense claims must be documented by a signature authorization form on file with the Campus Controller’s Office (or the Medical Center Controller, where appropriate) or by an electronic signature authorization. The travel expense claim should not be approved by a person who reports directly or indirectly to the traveler. Persons delegated the authority to approve travel shall not approve their own travel. In addition, travelers may not approve the travel of a near relative, e.g., spouse or domestic partner, child, parent, etc."</em></p>
                   <h3><strong>Traveler’s Signature</strong></h3>
                   <p>The following excerpts from G-28 outline the requirements for the Traveler’s Signature.</p>
                   <p><strong>c. Certification of Travel Expenses (G-28 pp 42-43)</strong></p>
                   <p><em>"The traveler must either sign or provide an electronic equivalent on the travel expense claim certifying that the amounts claimed are a true statement of the expenses incurred on official University business and that the original of all required receipts has been submitted, whether scanned or faxed. Internal departmental expense claim forms are not an acceptable alternative for obtaining the traveler’s signature on the travel expense claim (or electronic equivalent), unless approved as an exception to this policy."</em></p>
                   <p><em>"Submission of the travel expense claim under a traveler’s electronic authorization will be considered certification that the traveler incurred the expenses being claimed. In accordance with IRS regulations, an electronic signature must:</em></p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><em>Identify the traveler who is submitting the electronic form;</em></li>
                    <li><em>Authenticate and verify the submission; and</em></li>
                    <li><em>Be the final entry in the submission."</em></li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>In an attempt to accommodate situations where it is not possible for the Traveler to submit the expenses in Concur and the Traveler cannot sign the Travel Certification Form, UCSB has identified the following alternate options:</p>
                   <p><strong>Option 1. </strong>The traveler can submit original receipts with their original wet signature on each receipt.</p>
                   <p><strong>Option 2. </strong>The traveler can send an email from their account that includes copies of receipts and the statement below:</p>
                   <p>"I, (NAME OF TRAVELER), certify that the above is a true statement, that the expenses claimed were incurred by me on official University business on the dates shown, and that I have attached original receipts for each expense as required by University policy.”</p>

                   <p><strong>Comments added to Reports:</strong> BFS sees many Expense Reports re-submitted by Travelers without changes or comments. &nbsp;Travelers should always review all comments, make changes, add comments and re-submit for approval</p>
                   <p><strong>Mileage Documentation:</strong> Mileage reimbursement claims should always be supported by one of the following: CONCUR Mileage Calculator, Copy of Google/Mapquest Mileage Calculator or <a class="offsite" href="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1urW-Ny6IpiOvGvh0X98vef7IORl3o6i4">Transportation Log</a></p>
                   <p><strong>Group Meal Documentation:</strong> Reports for Group Travel or Entertainment with multiple attendees should include calculations to support per person meal amounts</p>
                   <p><strong>Exceptional Approval Forms:</strong> Care should be taken to select appropriate categories related to the particular exception requested</p>
                   <p><strong>Wire Payments: </strong>If a wire payment is required, please include “WIRE” in the report header record and attach the Wire Payment Request</p>
                   <p><strong>Personal Time:</strong> If a trip includes Personal Time, please include specific dates that have been identified as “personal”</p>
                   <p><strong>Restricted States:</strong> If travel is to a restricted state, please provide confirmation that activity and/or funding source is appropriate/allowable</p>
                   <p><strong>Alcohol: </strong>Documentation should include the calculation to show that alcohol and related tax has been excluded from the meal receipt, when applicable</p>
                   <p><strong>Guest Travelers:</strong> Remember to make sure signed certification is attached when a Report is submitted on behalf of a guest traveler</p>
                   <p><strong>Supporting Documents/Receipts: </strong>When required, receipts should be attached that support the particular expense line; combining multiple receipts in a single pdf makes review and approval difficult for approvers and can delay the processing of reports and reimbursement claims</p>
                   <p><strong>Business Purpose:</strong> Business purpose of trips should be specific and clearly identify the purpose of the trip</p>
                   <p><strong>Unusual/Atypical Situations: </strong>Reports should include line level comments to support unusual circumstances such as: airline itineraries that contain multiple locations or different departure and return locations, meals claimed on travel without lodging, etc.</p>
                   <p><strong>Purchase Description/Business Purpose:</strong> Provide a complete description of item purchased and specific business purpose</p>
                   <p><strong>Tax on Purchases: </strong>Care should be taken in completing the following sections when submitting Business Expense reports:</p>
